/**
 * A `Stream<R, E, A>` is a description of a program that, when evaluated, may
 * emit zero or more values of type `A`, may fail with errors of type `E`, and
 * uses an context of type `R`. One way to think of `Stream` is as a
 * `Effect` program that could emit multiple values.
 *
 * `Stream` is a purely functional *pull* based stream. Pull based streams offer
 * inherent laziness and backpressure, relieving users of the need to manage
 * buffers between operators. As an optimization, `Stream` does not emit
 * single values, but rather an array of values. This allows the cost of effect
 * evaluation to be amortized.
 *
 * `Stream` forms a monad on its `A` type parameter, and has error management
 * facilities for its `E` type parameter, modeled similarly to `Effect` (with
 * some adjustments for the multiple-valued nature of `Stream`). These aspects
 * allow for rich and expressive composition of streams.
