 * This module provides utility functions and type class instances for working with the `BigDecimal` type in TypeScript.

 * A `BigDecimal` allows storing any real number to arbitrary precision; which avoids common floating point errors
 * (such as 0.1 + 0.2 â‰  0.3) at the cost of complexity.
 *
 * Internally, `BigDecimal` uses a `BigInt` object, paired with a 64-bit integer which determines the position of the
 * decimal point. Therefore, the precision *is not* actually arbitrary, but limited to 2<sup>63</sup> decimal places.
 *
 * It is not recommended to convert a floating point number to a decimal directly, as the floating point representation

/**
 * This module provides types and utility functions to create and work with branded types,
 * which are TypeScript types with an added type tag to prevent accidental usage of a value in the wrong context.
 *
 * The `refined` and `nominal` functions are both used to create branded types in TypeScript.
 * The main difference between them is that `refined` allows for validation of the data, while `nominal` does not.
 *
 * The `nominal` function is used to create a new branded type that has the same underlying type as the input, but with a different name.
 * This is useful when you want to distinguish between two values of the same type that have different meanings.
 * The `nominal` function does not perform any validation of the input data.
 *
 * On the other hand, the `refined` function is used to create a new branded type that has the same underlying type as the input,
 * but with a different name, and it also allows for validation of the input data.
 * The `refined` function takes a predicate that is used to validate the input data.
 * If the input data fails the validation, a `BrandErrors` is returned, which provides information about the specific validation failure.

/**
 * The `Effect<R, E, A>` type is polymorphic in values of type `E` and we can
 * work with any error type that we want. However, there is a lot of information
 * that is not inside an arbitrary `E` value. So as a result, an `Effect` needs
 * somewhere to store things like unexpected errors or defects, stack and
 * execution traces, causes of fiber interruptions, and so forth.
 *
 * Effect-TS is very strict about preserving the full information related to a
 * failure. It captures all type of errors into the `Cause` data type. `Effect`
 * uses the `Cause<E>` data type to store the full story of failure. So its
 * error model is lossless. It doesn't throw information related to the failure
 * result. So we can figure out exactly what happened during the operation of
 * our effects.
 *
 * It is important to note that `Cause` is an underlying data type representing
 * errors occuring within an `Effect` workflow. Thus, we don't usually deal with
 * `Cause`s directly. Even though it is not a data type that we deal with very
 * often, the `Cause` of a failing `Effect` workflow can be accessed at any
 * time, which gives us total access to all parallel and sequential errors in
 * occurring within our codebase.
