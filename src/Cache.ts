/**
 * A `Cache` is defined in terms of a lookup function that, given a key of
 * type `Key`, can either fail with an error of type `Error` or succeed with a
 * value of type `Value`. Getting a value from the cache will either return
 * the previous result of the lookup function if it is available or else
 * compute a new result with the lookup function, put it in the cache, and
 * return it.
 *
 * A cache also has a specified capacity and time to live. When the cache is
 * at capacity the least recently accessed values in the cache will be
 * removed to make room for new values. Getting a value with a life older than
 * the specified time to live will result in a new value being computed with
 * the lookup function and returned when available.
 *
 * The cache is safe for concurrent access. If multiple fibers attempt to get
 * the same key the lookup function will only be computed once and the result
 * will be returned to all fibers.
