/**
 * A `Schedule<Env, In, Out>` defines a recurring schedule, which consumes
 * values of type `In`, and which returns values of type `Out`.
 *
 * Schedules are defined as a possibly infinite set of intervals spread out over
 * time. Each interval defines a window in which recurrence is possible.
 *
 * When schedules are used to repeat or retry effects, the starting boundary of
 * each interval produced by a schedule is used as the moment when the effect
 * will be executed again.
 *
 * Schedules compose in the following primary ways:
 *
 * - Union: performs the union of the intervals of two schedules
 * - Intersection: performs the intersection of the intervals of two schedules
 * - Sequence: concatenates the intervals of one schedule onto another
 *
 * In addition, schedule inputs and outputs can be transformed, filtered (to
 * terminate a schedule early in response to some input or output), and so
 * forth.
 *
 * A variety of other operators exist for transforming and combining schedules,
 * and the companion object for `Schedule` contains all common types of
 * schedules, both for performing retrying, as well as performing repetition.
