# Introduction

- **`cluster-workflow`** is designed to define and manage long-running and persistent workflows. ([README](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/cluster-workflow))
- **`cluster`** incorporates sharding to ensure that workflows are executed once in a scalable manner, providing orchestration to guarantee that only one instance runs at any given time.
