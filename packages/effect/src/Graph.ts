 *
 * Nodes and edges present in both graphs use data from `that`. The result has

 * Parallel edges with equal identities are also coalesced, with the last edge

 * Returns a maximum-cardinality matching of an undirected bipartite graph.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when assigning as many disjoint pairs as possible between the two sides
 * of a bipartite graph, such as workers to jobs or users to resources.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The bipartition is derived internally. Self-loops and odd cycles throw a
 * `GraphError`. Isolated nodes are allowed. Parallel edges do not change the
 * matching cardinality, and the first edge in graph order between each matched
 * pair is reported. Results follow left-partition graph order. Hopcroft-Karp
 * runs in `O(E * sqrt(V))` time.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * The graph must be undirected and bipartite. The derived left and right sides
 * are not based on stored edge orientation.
 *
 * **Example** (Matching a bipartite graph)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Graph } from "effect"
 *
 * const graph = Graph.undirected<string, string>((mutable) => {
 *   for (const node of ["A", "B", "X", "Y"]) Graph.addNode(mutable, node)

 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when decomposing an undirected graph into maximal regions that remain
 * connected after removing any one node from the region.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Articulation points can occur in more than one component. Isolated vertices
 * are excluded, while a vertex with a self-loop forms a singleton component.
 * Nodes within components and the components themselves follow graph order.
 * Parallel edges are treated independently. The iterative low-link traversal
 * is stack-safe and runs in `O(V + E)` time.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Throws a `GraphError` when used with a directed graph.
 *
 * **Example** (Finding biconnected components)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Graph } from "effect"
 *
 * const graph = Graph.undirected<void, void>((mutable) => {
 *   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) Graph.addNode(mutable, undefined)

 * Finds the shortest path from the configured source node to the target node
 * using the A* pathfinding algorithm.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when a meaningful heuristic can reduce point-to-point search compared
 * with Dijkstra's algorithm.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The edge-cost function must return non-negative weights and not `NaN`.
 * `Infinity` is allowed and behaves like an impassable edge. Returns
 * `Option.none()` when the target is not reachable.
 *
 * **Gotchas**

 * The heuristic must be consistent for the shortest-path guarantee and must
 * return finite values. Missing endpoints, invalid edge costs, or non-finite
 * heuristic values or arithmetic results throw a `GraphError`.

/**
 * Lazily enumerates all simple paths tied for minimum total cost.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when every distinct route tied for the minimum total cost is required.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Parallel edges produce distinct paths. Edge costs must be non-negative;
 * `Infinity` behaves as unavailable.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * The number of tied paths can still be large. Missing endpoints, invalid
 * costs, arithmetic overflow, or an invalid `limit` throw a `GraphError`.
 * Mutable graphs are snapshotted when iteration begins.

 * **When to use**

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The iterator uses Kahn's algorithm. Multiple valid orders may exist;

 * Creates a lazy depth-first postorder traversal iterator from the configured

 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when reachable descendants must be emitted before the nodes that lead to
 * them.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Nodes are emitted after their reachable descendants have been processed. If
 * no start nodes are supplied, the iterator is empty. The `direction` option
 * chooses whether to follow outgoing or incoming edges. The `radius` option
 * limits traversal by edge distance from the start nodes. It accepts
 * non-negative integers and `Infinity`; omitting it means unbounded traversal.
 * With a finite `radius`, a bounded breadth-first pass first determines
 * shortest-distance membership before nodes are emitted in postorder.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Invalid radii and missing start nodes throw a `GraphError`. Traversing a
 * mutable graph captures a snapshot when iteration begins; later mutations are
 * not observed by that iterator.
 *
 * **Example** (Traversing in postorder)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
