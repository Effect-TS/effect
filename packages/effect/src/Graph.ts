 * Composes two graphs, merging nodes by identity.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Nodes and edges present in both graphs use data from `that`. The result has
 * the same graph kind as `self`. Throws a `GraphError` when the graph kinds do
 * not match. `nodeIdentity` and `edgeIdentity` default to the complete node and
 * edge data. Edge identity also includes the endpoint identities.
 *
 * `G1 ∪ G2 = {V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2}`
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Nodes with equal identities in one input graph are coalesced. The last node
 * supplies the data, and redirected edges can collapse or become self-loops.
 * Parallel edges with equal identities are also coalesced, with the last edge
 * supplying the data.
 *
 * **Example** (Combining graphs)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Graph } from "effect"
 *
 * const left = Graph.directed<{ id: string }, string>((mutable) => {
 *   const a = Graph.addNode(mutable, { id: "A" })

/**
 * Exports a graph to Mermaid diagram format for visualization.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Mermaid is a popular diagram-as-code tool that generates flowcharts and other
 * visualizations from text-based definitions. This function converts Effect Graph
 * structures to valid Mermaid syntax for use in documentation, web applications,
 * and visualization tools.
 *
 * **Example** (Exporting a directed Mermaid diagram)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Graph } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic directed graph export
 * const graph = Graph.directed<string, number>((mutable) => {
 *   const app = Graph.addNode(mutable, "App")
 *   const db = Graph.addNode(mutable, "Database")
 *   const cache = Graph.addNode(mutable, "Cache")
 *   Graph.addEdge(mutable, app, db, 1)
 *   Graph.addEdge(mutable, app, cache, 2)
 * })
 *
 * const mermaid = Graph.toMermaid(graph)
 * console.log(mermaid)
 * // flowchart TD
 * //   0["App"]
 * //   1["Database"]
 * //   2["Cache"]
 * //   0 -->|"1"| 1
 * //   0 -->|"2"| 2
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Exporting an undirected Mermaid diagram)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Graph } from "effect"
 *
 * // Undirected graph with custom labels and direction
 * const socialGraph = Graph.undirected<{ name: string }, string>((mutable) => {

 *   const charlie = Graph.addNode(mutable, { name: "Charlie" })
 *   Graph.addEdge(mutable, alice, bob, "friends")

 * })
 *
 * const mermaid = Graph.toMermaid(socialGraph, {
 *   nodeLabel: (person) => person.name,
 *   edgeLabel: (relationship) => relationship,
 *   direction: "LR"
 * })
 * console.log(mermaid)

 *
 * **Example** (Customizing Mermaid node shapes)
