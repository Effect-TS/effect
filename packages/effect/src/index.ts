/**
 * The `Effect<A, E, R>` type is polymorphic in values of type `E` and we can

 * somewhere to store things like unexpected errors or defects, stack and

 *
 * Effect-TS is very strict about preserving the full information related to a

 * result. So we can figure out exactly what happened during the operation of
 * our effects.

 * It is important to note that `Cause` is an underlying data type representing

/**
 * # HashSet
 *
 * An immutable `HashSet` provides a collection of unique values with efficient
 * lookup, insertion and removal. Once created, a `HashSet` cannot be modified;
 * any operation that would alter the set instead returns a new `HashSet` with
 * the changes. This immutability offers benefits like predictable state
 * management and easier reasoning about your code.
 *
 * ## What Problem Does It Solve?
 *
 * `HashSet` solves the problem of maintaining an unsorted collection where each
 * value appears exactly once, with fast operations for checking membership and
 * adding/removing values.
 *
 * ## When to Use
 *
 * Use `HashSet` when you need:
 *
 * - A collection with no duplicate values
 * - Efficient membership testing (**`O(1)`** average complexity)
 * - Set operations like union, intersection, and difference
 * - An immutable data structure that preserves functional programming patterns
 *
 * ## Advanced Features
 *
 * HashSet provides operations for:
 *
 * - Transforming sets with map and flatMap
 * - Filtering elements with filter
 * - Combining sets with union, intersection and difference
 * - Performance optimizations via mutable operations in controlled contexts
 *
 * ## Performance Characteristics
 *
 * - **Lookup** operations ({@link module:HashSet.has}): **`O(1)`** average time
 *   complexity
 * - **Insertion** operations ({@link module:HashSet.add}): **`O(1)`** average time
 *   complexity
 * - **Removal** operations ({@link module:HashSet.remove}): **`O(1)`** average
 *   time complexity
 * - **Set** operations ({@link module:HashSet.union},
 *   {@link module:HashSet.intersection}): **`O(n)`** where n is the size of the
 *   smaller set
 * - **Iteration**: **`O(n)`** where n is the size of the set
 *
 * The HashSet data structure implements the following traits:
 *
 * - {@link Iterable}: allows iterating over the values in the set
 * - {@link Equal}: allows comparing two sets for value-based equality
 * - {@link Pipeable}: allows chaining operations with the pipe operator
 * - {@link Inspectable}: allows inspecting the contents of the set
 *

 *
 * ## Notes
 *
 * ### Composability with the Effect Ecosystem:
 *
 * This `HashSet` is designed to work seamlessly within the Effect ecosystem. It
 * implements the {@link Iterable}, {@link Equal}, {@link Pipeable}, and
 * {@link Inspectable} traits from Effect. This ensures compatibility with other
 * Effect data structures and functionalities. For example, you can easily use
 * Effect's `pipe` method to chain operations on the `HashSet`.
 *
 * **Equality of Elements with Effect's {@link Equal `Equal`} Trait:**
 *
 * This `HashSet` relies on Effect's {@link Equal} trait to determine the
 * uniqueness of elements within the set. The way equality is checked depends on
 * the type of the elements:
 *
 * - **Primitive Values:** For primitive JavaScript values like strings, numbers,
 *   booleans, `null`, and `undefined`, equality is determined by their value
 *   (similar to the `===` operator).
 * - **Objects and Custom Types:** For objects and other custom types, equality is
 *   determined by whether those types implement the {@link Equal} interface
 *   themselves. If an element type implements `Equal`, the `HashSet` will
 *   delegate to that implementation to perform the equality check. This allows
 *   you to define custom logic for determining when two instances of your
 *   objects should be considered equal based on their properties, rather than
 *   just their object identity.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Equal, Hash, HashSet } from "effect"
 *
 * class Person implements Equal.Equal {
 *   constructor(
 *     readonly id: number, // Unique identifier
 *     readonly name: string,
 *     readonly age: number
 *   ) {}
 *
 *   // Define equality based on id, name, and age
 *   [Equal.symbol](that: Equal.Equal): boolean {
 *     if (that instanceof Person) {
 *       return (
 *         Equal.equals(this.id, that.id) &&
 *         Equal.equals(this.name, that.name) &&
 *         Equal.equals(this.age, that.age)
 *       )
 *     }
 *     return false
 *   }
 *
 *   // Generate a hash code based on the unique id
 *   [Hash.symbol](): number {
 *     return Hash.hash(this.id)
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Creating a HashSet with objects that implement the Equal interface
 * const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(
 *   HashSet.add(new Person(1, "Alice", 30)),
 *   HashSet.add(new Person(1, "Alice", 30))
 * )
 *
 * // HashSet recognizes them as equal, so only one element is stored
 * console.log(HashSet.size(set))
 * // Output: 1
 * ```
 *
 * **Simplifying Equality and Hashing with `Data` and `Schema`:**
 *
 * Effect's {@link Data} and {@link Schema `Schema.Data`} modules offer powerful
 * ways to automatically handle the implementation of both the {@link Equal} and
 * {@link Hash} traits for your custom data structures.
 *
 * - **`Data` Module:** By using constructors like `Data.struct`, `Data.tuple`,
 *   `Data.array`, or `Data.case` to define your data types, Effect
 *   automatically generates the necessary implementations for value-based
 *   equality and consistent hashing. This significantly reduces boilerplate and
 *   ensures correctness.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { HashSet, Data, Equal } from "effect"
 * import assert from "node:assert/strict"
 *
 * // Data.* implements the `Equal` traits for us
 * const person1 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 })
 * const person2 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 })
 *
 * assert(Equal.equals(person1, person2))
 *
 * const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(
 *   HashSet.add(person1),
 *   HashSet.add(person2)
 * )
 *
 * // HashSet recognizes them as equal, so only one element is stored
 * console.log(HashSet.size(set)) // Output: 1
 * ```
 *
 * - **`Schema` Module:** When defining data schemas using the {@link Schema}
 *   module, you can use `Schema.Data` to automatically include the `Equal` and
 *   `Hash` traits in the decoded objects. This is particularly important when
 *   working with `HashSet`. **For decoded objects to be correctly recognized as
 *   equal within a `HashSet`, ensure that the schema for those objects is
 *   defined using `Schema.Data`.**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Equal, HashSet, Schema } from "effect"
 * import assert from "node:assert/strict"
 *
 * // Schema.Data implements the `Equal` traits for us
 * const PersonSchema = Schema.Data(
 *   Schema.Struct({
 *     id: Schema.Number,
 *     name: Schema.String,
 *     age: Schema.Number
 *   })
 * )
 *
 * const Person = Schema.decode(PersonSchema)
 *
 * const person1 = Person({ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 })
 * const person2 = Person({ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 })
 *
 * assert(Equal.equals(person1, person2)) // Output: true
 *
 * const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(
 *   HashSet.add(person1),
 *   HashSet.add(person2)
 * )
 *
 * // HashSet thanks to Schema.Data implementation of the `Equal` trait, recognizes the two Person as equal, so only one element is stored
 * console.log(HashSet.size(set)) // Output: 1
 * ```
 *
 * ### Interoperability with the JavaScript Runtime:
 *
 * To interoperate with the regular JavaScript runtime, Effect's `HashSet`
 * provides methods to access its elements in formats readily usable by
 * JavaScript APIs: {@link values `HashSet.values`},
 * {@link toValues `HashSet.toValues`}
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { HashSet } from "effect"
 *
 * const hashSet: HashSet.HashSet<number> = HashSet.make(1, 2, 3)
 *
 * // Using HashSet.values to convert HashSet.HashSet<A> to IterableIterator<A>
 * const iterable: IterableIterator<number> = HashSet.values(hashSet)
 *
 * console.log(...iterable) // Logs:  1 2 3
 *
 * // Using HashSet.toValues to convert HashSet.HashSet<A> to Array<A>
 * const array: Array<number> = HashSet.toValues(hashSet)
 *
 * console.log(array) // Logs: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
 * ```
 *
 * Be mindful of performance implications (both time and space complexity) when
 * frequently converting between Effect's immutable HashSet and mutable
 * JavaScript data structures, especially for large collections.

 *
 * **Performance**
 *
 * - Time: `List` has `O(1)` prepend and head/tail access. Most other operations are `O(n)` on the number of elements in the list. This includes the index-based lookup of elements, `length`, `append` and `reverse`.

/**
 * The `effect/match` module provides a type-safe pattern matching system for
 * TypeScript. Inspired by functional programming, it simplifies conditional
 * logic by replacing verbose if/else or switch statements with a structured and
 * expressive API.
 *
 * This module supports matching against types, values, and discriminated unions
 * while enforcing exhaustiveness checking to ensure all cases are handled.
 *
 * Although pattern matching is not yet a native JavaScript feature,
 * `effect/match` offers a reliable implementation that is available today.
 *
 * **How Pattern Matching Works**
 *
 * Pattern matching follows a structured process:
 *
 * - **Creating a matcher**: Define a `Matcher` that operates on either a
 *   specific `Match.type` or `Match.value`.
 *
 * - **Defining patterns**: Use combinators such as `Match.when`, `Match.not`,
 *   and `Match.tag` to specify matching conditions.
 *
 * - **Completing the match**: Apply a finalizer such as `Match.exhaustive`,
 *   `Match.orElse`, or `Match.option` to determine how unmatched cases should
 *   be handled.

/**
 * # MutableHashSet
 *
 * A mutable `MutableHashSet` provides a collection of unique values with
 * efficient lookup, insertion and removal. Unlike its immutable sibling
 * {@link module:HashSet}, a `MutableHashSet` can be modified in-place;
 * operations like add, remove, and clear directly modify the original set
 * rather than creating a new one. This mutability offers benefits like improved
 * performance in scenarios where you need to build or modify a set
 * incrementally.
 *
 * ## What Problem Does It Solve?
 *
 * `MutableHashSet` solves the problem of maintaining an unsorted collection
 * where each value appears exactly once, with fast operations for checking
 * membership and adding/removing values, in contexts where mutability is
 * preferred for performance or implementation simplicity.
 *
 * ## When to Use
 *
 * Use `MutableHashSet` when you need:
 *
 * - A collection with no duplicate values
 * - Efficient membership testing (**`O(1)`** average complexity)
 * - In-place modifications for better performance
 * - A set that will be built or modified incrementally
 * - Local mutability in otherwise immutable code
 *
 * ## Advanced Features
 *
 * MutableHashSet provides operations for:
 *
 * - Adding and removing elements with direct mutation
 * - Checking for element existence
 * - Clearing all elements at once
 * - Converting to/from other collection types
 *
 * ## Performance Characteristics
 *
 * - **Lookup** operations ({@link module:MutableHashSet.has}): **`O(1)`** average
 *   time complexity
 * - **Insertion** operations ({@link module:MutableHashSet.add}): **`O(1)`**
 *   average time complexity
 * - **Removal** operations ({@link module:MutableHashSet.remove}): **`O(1)`**
 *   average time complexity
 * - **Iteration**: **`O(n)`** where n is the size of the set
 *
 * The MutableHashSet data structure implements the following traits:
 *
 * - {@link Iterable}: allows iterating over the values in the set
 * - {@link Pipeable}: allows chaining operations with the pipe operator
 * - {@link Inspectable}: allows inspecting the contents of the set

 * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.add}          | Adds a value to the set             | O(1) avg   |
 * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.remove}       | Removes a value from the set        | O(1) avg   |
 * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.size}         | Gets the number of elements         | O(1)       |
 * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.clear}        | Removes all values from the set     | O(1)       |
 *
 * ## Notes
 *
 * ### Mutability Considerations:
 *
 * Unlike most data structures in the Effect ecosystem, `MutableHashSet` is
 * mutable. This means that operations like `add`, `remove`, and `clear` modify
 * the original set rather than creating a new one. This can lead to more
 * efficient code in some scenarios, but requires careful handling to avoid
 * unexpected side effects.
 *
 * ### When to Choose `MutableHashSet` vs {@link module:HashSet}:
 *
 * - Use `MutableHashSet` when you need to build or modify a set incrementally and
 *   performance is a priority
 * - Use `HashSet` when you want immutability guarantees and functional
 *   programming patterns
 * - Consider using {@link module:HashSet}'s bounded mutation context (via
 *   {@link module:HashSet.beginMutation}, {@link module:HashSet.endMutation}, and
 *   {@link module:HashSet.mutate} methods) when you need temporary mutability
 *   within an otherwise immutable context - this approach might be sufficient
 *   for many use cases without requiring a separate `MutableHashSet`
 * - `MutableHashSet` is often useful for local operations where the mutability is
 *   contained and doesn't leak into the broader application

 * ## Composition Patterns and Type Safety
 *
 * When building function pipelines, understanding how types flow through
 * operations is critical:
 *
 * ### Composing with type-preserving operations
 *
 * Most operations in this module are type-preserving (`number → number`),
 * making them easily composable in pipelines:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { pipe } from "effect"
 * import * as Number from "effect/Number"
 *
 * const result = pipe(
 *   10,
 *   Number.increment, // number → number
 *   Number.multiply(2), // number → number
 *   Number.round(1) // number → number
 * ) // Result: number (21)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Working with Option results
 *
 * Operations that might fail (like division by zero) return Option types and
 * require Option combinators:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { pipe, Option } from "effect"
 * import * as Number from "effect/Number"
 *
 * const result = pipe(
 *   10,
 *   Number.divide(0), // number → Option<number>
 *   Option.getOrElse(() => 0) // Option<number> → number
 * ) // Result: number (0)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Composition best practices
 *
 * - Chain type-preserving operations for maximum composability
 * - Use Option combinators when working with potentially failing operations
 * - Consider using Effect for operations that might fail with specific errors
 * - Remember that all operations maintain JavaScript's floating-point precision
 *   limitations

 * This module provides an implementation of the `Order` type class which is used to define a total ordering on some type `A`.

 * - if `x <= y` and `y <= x`, then `x == y` (antisymmetry)

/**
 * A `Trie` is used for locating specific `string` keys from within a set.
 *
 * It works similar to `HashMap`, but with keys required to be `string`.
 * This constraint unlocks some performance optimizations and new methods to get string prefixes (e.g. `keysWithPrefix`, `longestPrefixOf`).
 *
 * Prefix search is also the main feature that makes a `Trie` more suited than `HashMap` for certain usecases.
 *
 * A `Trie` is often used to store a dictionary (list of words) that can be searched
 * in a manner that allows for efficient generation of completion lists
 * (e.g. predict the rest of a word a user is typing).
 *
 * A `Trie` has O(n) lookup time where `n` is the size of the key,
 * or even less than `n` on search misses.
