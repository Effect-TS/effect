/**
 * What a chat platform adapter implements.
 *
 * An adapter is a set of `Ops` plus a static `Descriptor` of what the
 * platform supports. Adapters register in the `Registry`, which `Chat`
 * routes through by `thread.platform`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Every op exists on every platform. Where the platform has no equivalent
 *   the op fails with `Unsupported`, naming the capability.
 * - A post notifies nobody unless asked: mentions in Markdown do not notify by
 *   default.
 * - Length is checked before the call, with `checkMessageLength`, in the
 *   unit the descriptor's `measure` counts.
 * - Adapters retry `retry` failures with `retrySafe` and never retry
 *   `uncertain` ones.

/**
 * Static description of a platform: its capabilities and limits, readable
 * without a call to the platform.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - An op whose capability is missing from `capabilities` fails with
 *   `Unsupported`.
 * - `limits.messageLength` is the platform's own limit for one message, in
 *   the platform's own unit.
 * - `measure` gives what a Markdown string costs against
 *   `limits.messageLength` and `limits.streamLength`. It is pure and makes
 *   no call to the platform. It is an upper bound, never less than what the
 *   adapter sends for the text, and it adds up:
 *   `measure(a + b) <= measure(a) + measure(b)`. It measures ASCII letters
 *   at one each.
 * - `limits.minWriteInterval` is the default floor between two writes to one
 *   thread, for streamed and multi-part posts.
 * - `limits.streamLength` and `limits.streamAge` apply to native streams
 *   only. `streamLength` is never more than `messageLength`, so a stream's
 *   text always fits an `edit`.
