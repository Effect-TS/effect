/**
 * Posting long and streamed Markdown through `Chat`.
 *
 * `post` splits Markdown that outgrows one message into parts at block
 * boundaries. `stream` writes a stream of Markdown deltas as it arrives, by
 * the adapter's native stream when it has one and otherwise by posting and
 * then editing. Both sit above the adapter ops and use one splitter.
 *
 * **Example** (Streaming a reply)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Stream } from "effect"
 * import { ChatMarkdown, ChatThread } from "effect/chat"
 *
 * const reply = (deltas: Stream.Stream<string>) =>
 *   Effect.gen(function*() {
 *     const result = yield* ChatMarkdown.stream(ChatThread.make("slack", "T1/C1"), deltas)
 *     return result.parts.map((part) => part.messageId)
 *   })

/**
 * Posts Markdown of any length, split into as many messages as it needs.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - A part ends at a block boundary: after a blank line or a closed code
 *   fence. A block too long for one message is cut at a line, closing the code
 *   fence it is in and reopening it in the next part. Length is measured with
 *   the adapter's `measure`.
 * - Each part is posted once and never edited. Parts are paced by
 *   `minWriteInterval`.
 * - `files` go with the last part, or with the overflow file when there is
 *   one. Blank text after the last cut stays with the last part.
 * - With `unattachedNote`, a post with files that fails `denied` with
 *   detail `file_refused` is tried once more without them, ending in the note,
 *   or followed by the note when it does not fit. Any failure of that post
 *   fails the call. Without `unattachedNote` the first failure fails the
 *   call. An `uncertain` failure records the part in `uncertain` and posts no note.
 * - A `TooLarge` without detail `file_refused` fails the call, even with
 *   `subject: "files"` or text that measured as fitting. Fallback requires
 *   `denied` plus `file_refused`; `subject` never controls it.
 * - An empty input posts nothing and succeeds with no parts, unless there are
 *   files, which then go out in a message of their own.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * A failure in the middle leaves the parts already posted in place. The error
 * says what was posted and what was not.

/**
 * Writes a stream of Markdown deltas as one reply, as the text arrives.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - With a `recipient` and an adapter that has a native stream, the reply is
 *   written by native appends. Otherwise, or when the first native start fails
 *   with `Unsupported`, it posts and then edits. The result and the span say
 *   which ran.
 * - Text that outgrows a message rolls over into a new one at a block
 *   boundary, and each new message counts against `maxParts`. A native stream
 *   rolls over at the next block boundary past 85% of `limits.streamLength`,
 *   and rotates once it is 80% of `limits.streamAge` old. Every append leaves
 *   room to close the code fence it ends in, and a rollover or rotation closes
 *   it.
 * - Writes are paced by `minWriteInterval`, on `Clock`. The next write is
 *   scheduled only after the previous one returns, and takes all the text that
 *   arrived meanwhile.
 * - An append holds back the unfinished last line, unless inside a code fence.
 *   An edit closes an open code fence.
 * - An intermediate edit that fails `retry` or `uncertain` is dropped, since
 *   the next edit carries the whole text. A `denied` failure, and any failure
 *   of a post or of a part's last edit, fails the reply.
 * - A native append that fails `retry` is tried again after its
 *   `retryAfter`, or the write interval, whether or not new text arrived.
 *   Three in a row, or one `uncertain` failure, stop the stream, edit the part
 *   to its whole known text, the failed chunk included, and carry on by
 *   post-then-edit. `TooLarge` starts the next part with the chunk.
 * - `Result.stopped` is true when a user clicked stop on the reply. The
 *   upstream is then interrupted.
 * - When the upstream fails or the call is interrupted, what was received is
 *   written out, with an open code fence closed, within a short timeout, and
 *   left posted. The timeout starts at once, even while a write is in
 *   flight. A post, start or append in flight is not cut off by the failure
 *   or the interrupt, since sending it again could repeat text: the finalizer
 *   waits for it, then sends what follows, a stop cut off by the interrupt
 *   included. Only the timeout cuts a write off, and its text is then
 *   reported as `uncertain`.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - There are no files: post them after the result, when it is known whether
 *   the reply stopped.
 * - To stop a reply, end `deltas` with `Stream.interruptWhen` or
 *   `Stream.haltWhen`, so a `Result` still comes back. Interrupting the call
 *   leaves only the ids collected through `onPart`.
 * - Native writes go to the adapter through the `Registry`, so a layer that
 *   wraps `Chat` does not see them.
 * - A native part that is rolled over on `TooLarge` can end inside an open
 *   code fence, since it can no longer be appended to. The next part reopens
 *   the fence.
 * - Post-then-edit needs the `edit` capability.
