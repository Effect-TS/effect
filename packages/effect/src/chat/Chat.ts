/**
 * The routed outbound chat service.
 *
 * `Chat` has the ops of every registered adapter and routes each call by the
 * address's platform. `Chat.layer` provides the router and an empty
 * `ChatAdapter.Registry`; adapter layers stack on top with
 * `Layer.provideMerge`, and a platform that is off is a layer left out.
 *
 * **Example** (Posting through the router)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Chat, ChatThread } from "effect/chat"
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const chat = yield* Chat.Chat
 *   const posted = yield* chat.post(ChatThread.make("slack", "T1/C1"), { markdown: "Hello" })
 *   return posted.id
 * })
 * ```

 * Service that routes chat operations to the adapter registered for each

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Every op takes an address and goes to the adapter for
 *   `thread.platform`, failing with `NoAdapter` when there is none.
 * - `getUser` takes the platform first, because a bare user id names none.
 * - `followUp` is routed by the platform of the deferred command's thread.
 * - `descriptor` returns a platform's capabilities and limits.
 * - Each call runs in a `Chat.{op}` span whose attributes are the platform, the
 *   op and, on failure, the error reason and retry value.
