 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when you need schema parse errors in
 * [Standard Schema V1](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema)
 * format, optionally customizing leaf or check issue rendering.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Returns a `Formatter<StandardSchemaV1.FailureResult>`.
 * - Each leaf issue is flattened into `{ message, path }` entries.
 * - `Pointer` paths are accumulated to produce full property paths.
 * - Falls back to {@link defaultLeafHook} / {@link defaultCheckHook} when no
 *   hooks are provided.
 * - Default messages include reported input when the issue that produces the
 *   message has an `input` field. The returned Standard Schema issues do not
 *   receive an `input` field.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Reported input can appear inside the Standard Schema `message` string even
 * though it is not exposed as a separate property. Custom hooks control their
 * complete message and are not modified.
 *
 * **Example** (Creating a Standard Schema V1 formatter)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Flattens the issue tree into `{ message, path }` entries using

 * - Includes reported input in default messages when the node producing the

 * - Multiple entries are joined with newlines.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Formatting an issue can disclose input retained with `reportInput: true`.
 * Wrapper inputs are not inherited by child messages, and custom messages are
 * returned unchanged.
