 * effect runs.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Fibers waiting on the `Deferred` receive the computed value only if this call
 * completes it. The returned effect succeeds with `true` when this call
 * completed the `Deferred`, or `false` if it was already completed.
 *
 * **Example** (Completing a Deferred with a lazy value)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Deferred, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const deferred = yield* Deferred.make<number>()
 *   yield* Deferred.sync(deferred, () => 42)
 *   return yield* Deferred.await(deferred)
 * })
 *
 * await Effect.runPromise(program) // => 42
 * ```

 * Attempts to complete the `Deferred` synchronously with the specified

 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use to complete a `Deferred` synchronously in low-level code that already has
 * the completion effect.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This mutates the `Deferred` directly and should be reserved for low-level
 * code; prefer the effectful completion APIs when possible. Returns `true` if
 * this call completed the `Deferred`, or `false` if it was already completed.
 *
 * **Example** (Completing a Deferred unsafely)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Deferred, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const deferred = Deferred.makeUnsafe<number>()
 * Deferred.doneUnsafe(deferred, Effect.succeed(42)) // => true
 * ```

 * Runs an `Effect` and attempts to complete a `Deferred` with the effect's

 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use to pipe an effect result into a `Deferred` while preserving success,
 * failure, defects, and interruption.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * If the effect succeeds, fails, dies, or is interrupted, that result is used
 * as the attempted completion. The returned effect cannot fail; it succeeds
 * with `true` if it completed the `Deferred`, or `false` if the `Deferred` was
 * already completed.

 * **Example** (Completing a Deferred from an effect result)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Deferred, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const successEffect = Effect.succeed(42)
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const deferred = yield* Deferred.make<number, string>()
