/**
 * The `Effect<A, E, R>` type is polymorphic in values of type `E` and we can
 * work with any error type that we want. However, there is a lot of information
 * that is not inside an arbitrary `E` value. So as a result, an `Effect` needs
 * somewhere to store things like unexpected errors or defects, stack and
 * execution traces, causes of fiber interruptions, and so forth.
 *
 * Effect-TS is very strict about preserving the full information related to a
 * failure. It captures all type of errors into the `Cause` data type. `Effect`
 * uses the `Cause<E>` data type to store the full story of failure. So its
 * error model is lossless. It doesn't throw information related to the failure
 * result. So we can figure out exactly what happened during the operation of
 * our effects.
 *
 * It is important to note that `Cause` is an underlying data type representing
 * errors occuring within an `Effect` workflow. Thus, we don't usually deal with
 * `Cause`s directly. Even though it is not a data type that we deal with very
 * often, the `Cause` of a failing `Effect` workflow can be accessed at any
 * time, which gives us total access to all parallel and sequential errors in
 * occurring within our codebase.
