 * The `Effect` interface defines a value that describes a workflow or job,

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The `Effect` interface represents a computation that can model a workflow
 * involving various types of operations, such as synchronous, asynchronous,
 * concurrent, and parallel interactions. It operates within a context of type
 * `R`, and the result can either be a success with a value of type `A` or a
 * failure with an error of type `E`. The `Effect` is designed to handle complex
 * interactions with external resources, offering advanced features such as
 * fiber-based concurrency, scheduling, interruption handling, and scalability.
 * This makes it suitable for tasks that require fine-grained control over
 * concurrency and error management.
 *
 * To execute an `Effect` value, you need a `Runtime`, which provides the
 * environment necessary to run and manage the computation.

/**
 * Returns an effect that caches its result for a specified `Duration`,
 * known as "timeToLive" (TTL).
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function is used to cache the result of an effect for a specified amount
 * of time. This means that the first time the effect is evaluated, its result
 * is computed and stored.
 *
 * If the effect is evaluated again within the specified `timeToLive`, the
 * cached result will be used, avoiding recomputation.
 *
 * After the specified duration has passed, the cache expires, and the effect
 * will be recomputed upon the next evaluation.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you have an effect that involves costly operations or
 * computations, and you want to avoid repeating them within a short time frame.
 *
 * It's ideal for scenarios where the result of an effect doesn't change
 * frequently and can be reused for a specified duration.
 *
 * By caching the result, you can improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary
 * computations, especially in performance-critical applications.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * let i = 1
 * const expensiveTask = Effect.promise<string>(() => {
 *   console.log("expensive task...")
 *   return new Promise((resolve) => {

/**
 * Caches an effect's result for a specified duration and allows manual
 * invalidation before expiration.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function behaves similarly to {@link cachedWithTTL} by caching the
 * result of an effect for a specified period of time. However, it introduces an
 * additional feature: it provides an effect that allows you to manually
 * invalidate the cached result before it naturally expires.
 *
 * This gives you more control over the cache, allowing you to refresh the
 * result when needed, even if the original cache has not yet expired.
 *
 * Once the cache is invalidated, the next time the effect is evaluated, the
 * result will be recomputed, and the cache will be refreshed.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you have an effect whose result needs to be cached for
 * a certain period, but you also want the option to refresh the cache manually
 * before the expiration time.
 *
 * This is useful when you need to ensure that the cached data remains valid for
 * a certain period but still want to invalidate it if the underlying data
 * changes or if you want to force a recomputation.

/**
 * Returns a memoized version of a function with effects, reusing results for

 * **Details**
 *
 * This function creates a memoized version of a given function that performs an

 * **When to Use**

 * Use this function when you have a function that performs an effect and you

/**
 * Combines multiple effects into one, returning results based on the input
 * structure.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Use this function when you need to run multiple effects and combine their
 * results into a single output. It supports tuples, iterables, structs, and
 * records, making it flexible for different input types.
 *
 * For instance, if the input is a tuple:
 *
 * ```ts skip-type-checking
 * //         ┌─── a tuple of effects
 * //         ▼
 * Effect.all([effect1, effect2, ...])
 * ```
 *
 * the effects are executed sequentially, and the result is a new effect
 * containing the results as a tuple. The results in the tuple match the order
 * of the effects passed to `Effect.all`.
 *
 * **Concurrency**
 *
 * You can control the execution order (e.g., sequential vs. concurrent) using
 * the `concurrency` option.
 *
 * **Short-Circuiting Behavior**
 *
 * This function stops execution on the first error it encounters, this is
 * called "short-circuiting". If any effect in the collection fails, the
 * remaining effects will not run, and the error will be propagated. To change
 * this behavior, you can use the `mode` option, which allows all effects to run
 * and collect results as `Either` or `Option`.
 *
 * **The `mode` option**
 *
 * The `{ mode: "either" }` option changes the behavior of `Effect.all` to
 * ensure all effects run, even if some fail. Instead of stopping on the first
 * failure, this mode collects both successes and failures, returning an array
 * of `Either` instances where each result is either a `Right` (success) or a
 * `Left` (failure).
 *
 * Similarly, the `{ mode: "validate" }` option uses `Option` to indicate
 * success or failure. Each effect returns `None` for success and `Some` with
 * the error for failure.
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Effects in Tuples)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const tupleOfEffects = [
 *   Effect.succeed(42).pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log)),
 *   Effect.succeed("Hello").pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log))
 * ] as const
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<[number, string], never, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const resultsAsTuple = Effect.all(tupleOfEffects)
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(resultsAsTuple).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 42
 * // Hello
 * // [ 42, 'Hello' ]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Effects in Iterables)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const iterableOfEffects: Iterable<Effect.Effect<number>> = [1, 2, 3].map(
 *   (n) => Effect.succeed(n).pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log))
 * )
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<number[], never, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const resultsAsArray = Effect.all(iterableOfEffects)
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(resultsAsArray).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 1
 * // 2
 * // 3
 * // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Effects in Structs)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const structOfEffects = {
 *   a: Effect.succeed(42).pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log)),

 *
 * Effect.runPromise(resultsAsStruct).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 42
 * // Hello
 * // { a: 42, b: 'Hello' }
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Effects in Records)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const recordOfEffects: Record<string, Effect.Effect<number>> = {
 *   key1: Effect.succeed(1).pipe(Effect.tap(Console.log)),

 *
 * Effect.runPromise(resultsAsRecord).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // 1
 * // 2
 * // { key1: 1, key2: 2 }
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Short-Circuiting Behavior)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const program = Effect.all([

/**
 * Executes an effectful operation for each element in an `Iterable`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function applies a provided operation to each element in the iterable,
 * producing a new effect that returns an array of results.
 *
 * If any effect fails, the iteration stops immediately (short-circuiting), and
 * the error is propagated.
 *
 * **Concurrency**
 *
 * The `concurrency` option controls how many operations are performed
 * concurrently. By default, the operations are performed sequentially.
 *
 * **Discarding Results**
 *
 * If the `discard` option is set to `true`, the intermediate results are not
 * collected, and the final result of the operation is `void`.
 *
 * **Example** (Applying Effects to Iterable Elements)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const result = Effect.forEach([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (n, index) =>
 *   Console.log(`Currently at index ${index}`).pipe(Effect.as(n * 2))
 * )
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(result).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // Currently at index 0
 * // Currently at index 1
 * // Currently at index 2
 * // Currently at index 3
 * // Currently at index 4
 * // [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Discarding Results)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * // Apply effects but discard the results
 * const result = Effect.forEach(
 *   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
 *   (n, index) =>
 *     Console.log(`Currently at index ${index}`).pipe(Effect.as(n * 2)),

/**
 * Processes an iterable and applies an effectful function to each element,

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function processes each element in the provided iterable by applying an
 * effectful function to it. The results are then categorized into two separate
 * lists: one for failures and another for successes. This separation allows you
 * to handle the two categories differently. Failures are collected in a list
 * without interrupting the processing of the remaining elements, so the
 * operation continues even if some elements fail. This is particularly useful
 * when you need to handle both successful and failed results separately,
 * without stopping the entire process on encountering a failure.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you want to process a collection of items and handle
 * errors or failures without interrupting the processing of other items. It's
 * useful when you need to distinguish between successful and failed results and
 * process them separately, for example, when logging errors while continuing to
 * work with valid data. The function ensures that failures are captured, while
 * successes are processed normally.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<[string[], number[]], never, never>
 * //      ▼

/**
 * This function is similar to {@link validateAll} but with a key difference: it
 * returns the first successful result or all errors if none of the operations
 * succeed.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function processes a collection of elements and applies an effectful
 * operation to each. Unlike {@link validateAll}, which accumulates both
 * successes and failures, `Effect.validateFirst` stops and returns the first
 * success it encounters. If no success occurs, it returns all accumulated
 * errors. This can be useful when you are interested in the first successful
 * result and want to avoid processing further once a valid result is found.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<number, string[], never>
 * //      ▼
 * const program = Effect.validateFirst([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (n) => {
 *   if (n < 4) {
 *     return Effect.fail(`${n} is not less that 4`)
 *   } else {
 *     return Console.log(`item ${n}`).pipe(Effect.as(n))
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log, console.error)
 * // Output:
 * // item 4
 * // 4
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link validateAll} for a similar function that accumulates all results.
 * @see {@link firstSuccessOf} for a similar function that processes multiple
 * effects and returns the first successful one or the last error.

/**
 * Creates an `Effect` from a callback-based asynchronous function.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The `resume` function:
 * - Must be called exactly once. Any additional calls will be ignored.
 * - Can return an optional `Effect` that will be run if the `Fiber` executing
 *   this `Effect` is interrupted. This can be useful in scenarios where you
 *   need to handle resource cleanup if the operation is interrupted.
 * - Can receive an `AbortSignal` to handle interruption if needed.
 *
 * The `FiberId` of the fiber that may complete the async callback may also be
 * specified using the `blockingOn` argument. This is called the "blocking
 * fiber" because it suspends the fiber executing the `async` effect (i.e.
 * semantically blocks the fiber from making progress). Specifying this fiber id
 * in cases where it is known will improve diagnostics, but not affect the
 * behavior of the returned effect.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use `Effect.async` when dealing with APIs that use callback-style instead of
 * `async/await` or `Promise`.
 *
 * **Example** (Wrapping a Callback API)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import * as NodeFS from "node:fs"
 *
 * const readFile = (filename: string) =>
 *   Effect.async<Buffer, Error>((resume) => {
 *     NodeFS.readFile(filename, (error, data) => {
 *       if (error) {
 *         // Resume with a failed Effect if an error occurs
 *         resume(Effect.fail(error))
 *       } else {
 *         // Resume with a succeeded Effect if successful
 *         resume(Effect.succeed(data))
 *       }
 *     })
 *   })
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<Buffer, Error, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const program = readFile("example.txt")
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Handling Interruption with Cleanup)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect"
 * import * as NodeFS from "node:fs"
 *
 * // Simulates a long-running operation to write to a file
 * const writeFileWithCleanup = (filename: string, data: string) =>
 *   Effect.async<void, Error>((resume) => {
 *     const writeStream = NodeFS.createWriteStream(filename)
 *
 *     // Start writing data to the file
 *     writeStream.write(data)
 *
 *     // When the stream is finished, resume with success
 *     writeStream.on("finish", () => resume(Effect.void))
 *
 *     // In case of an error during writing, resume with failure
 *     writeStream.on("error", (err) => resume(Effect.fail(err)))
 *
 *     // Handle interruption by returning a cleanup effect
 *     return Effect.sync(() => {
 *       console.log(`Cleaning up ${filename}`)
 *       NodeFS.unlinkSync(filename)
 *     })
 *   })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const fiber = yield* Effect.fork(
 *     writeFileWithCleanup("example.txt", "Some long data...")
 *   )
 *   // Simulate interrupting the fiber after 1 second
 *   yield* Effect.sleep("1 second")
 *   yield* Fiber.interrupt(fiber) // This will trigger the cleanup
 * })
 *
 * // Run the program
 * Effect.runPromise(program)
 * // Output:
 * // Cleaning up example.txt
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Handling Interruption with AbortSignal)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect"
 *
 * // A task that supports interruption using AbortSignal
 * const interruptibleTask = Effect.async<void, Error>((resume, signal) => {
 *   // Handle interruption
 *   signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
 *     console.log("Abort signal received")
 *     clearTimeout(timeoutId)
 *   })
 *
 *   // Simulate a long-running task
 *   const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
 *     console.log("Operation completed")
 *     resume(Effect.void)
 *   }, 2000)
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const fiber = yield* Effect.fork(interruptibleTask)
 *   // Simulate interrupting the fiber after 1 second
 *   yield* Effect.sleep("1 second")
 *   yield* Fiber.interrupt(fiber)

 * **Details**
 *
 * The `Effect.suspend` function takes a thunk that represents the effect and

 * until it is explicitly needed, which is helpful in various scenarios:
 * - **Lazy Evaluation**: Helps optimize performance by deferring computations,
 *   especially when the effect might not be needed, or when its computation is
 *   expensive. This also ensures that any side effects or scoped captures are
 *   re-executed on each invocation.
 * - **Handling Circular Dependencies**: Useful in managing circular
 *   dependencies, such as recursive functions that need to avoid eager
 *   evaluation to prevent stack overflow.
 * - **Unifying Return Types**: Can help TypeScript unify return types in
 *   situations where multiple branches of logic return different effects,
 *   simplifying type inference.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you need to defer the evaluation of an effect until it
 * is required. This is particularly useful for optimizing expensive
 * computations, managing circular dependencies, or resolving type inference
 * issues.
 *
 * **Example** (Lazy Evaluation with Side Effects)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * let i = 0
 *
 * const bad = Effect.succeed(i++)
 *
 * const good = Effect.suspend(() => Effect.succeed(i++))
 *
 * console.log(Effect.runSync(bad)) // Output: 0
 * console.log(Effect.runSync(bad)) // Output: 0
 *
 * console.log(Effect.runSync(good)) // Output: 1
 * console.log(Effect.runSync(good)) // Output: 2
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Recursive Fibonacci)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const blowsUp = (n: number): Effect.Effect<number> =>
 *   n < 2
 *     ? Effect.succeed(1)
 *     : Effect.zipWith(blowsUp(n - 1), blowsUp(n - 2), (a, b) => a + b)
 *
 * console.log(Effect.runSync(blowsUp(32)))
 * // crash: JavaScript heap out of memory
 *
 * const allGood = (n: number): Effect.Effect<number> =>
 *   n < 2
 *     ? Effect.succeed(1)
 *     : Effect.zipWith(
 *         Effect.suspend(() => allGood(n - 1)),
 *         Effect.suspend(() => allGood(n - 2)),
 *         (a, b) => a + b
 *       )
 *
 * console.log(Effect.runSync(allGood(32)))
 * // Output: 3524578
 * ```
 *

 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"

/**
 * Catches and recovers from specific types of errors, allowing you to attempt
 * recovery only for certain errors.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * `catchSome` lets you selectively catch and handle errors of certain
 * types by providing a recovery effect for specific errors. If the error
 * matches a condition, recovery is attempted; if not, it doesn't affect the
 * program. This function doesn't alter the error type, meaning the error type
 * remains the same as in the original effect.

 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Random, Option } from "effect"
 *
 * class HttpError {
 *   readonly _tag = "HttpError"
 * }

/**
 * Recovers from specific defects using a provided partial function.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * `catchSomeDefect` allows you to handle specific defects, which are
 * unexpected errors that can cause the program to stop. It uses a partial
 * function to catch only certain defects and ignores others. The function does
 * not handle expected errors (such as those caused by {@link fail}) or
 * interruptions in execution (like those caused by {@link interrupt}).
 *
 * This function provides a way to handle certain types of defects while
 * allowing others to propagate and cause failure in the program.
 *
 * **Note**: There is no sensible way to recover from defects. This method
 * should be used only at the boundary between Effect and an external system, to
 * transmit information on a defect for diagnostic or explanatory purposes.
 *
 * **How the Partial Function Works**
 *
 * The function provided to `catchSomeDefect` acts as a filter and a handler for defects:
 * - It receives the defect as an input.
 * - If the defect matches a specific condition (e.g., a certain error type), the function returns
 *   an `Option.some` containing the recovery logic.
 * - If the defect does not match, the function returns `Option.none`, allowing the defect to propagate.
 *
 * **Example** (Handling Specific Defects)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Cause, Option, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * // Simulating a runtime error
 * const task = Effect.dieMessage("Boom!")
 *
 * const program = Effect.catchSomeDefect(task, (defect) => {
 *   if (Cause.isIllegalArgumentException(defect)) {
 *     return Option.some(
 *       Console.log(
 *         `Caught an IllegalArgumentException defect: ${defect.message}`
 *       )
 *     )
 *   }
 *   return Option.none()
 * })
 *
 * // Since we are only catching IllegalArgumentException
 * // we will get an Exit.Failure because we simulated a runtime error.
 * Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // {
 * //   _id: 'Exit',
 * //   _tag: 'Failure',
 * //   cause: {
 * //     _id: 'Cause',
 * //     _tag: 'Die',

 *
 * **When to Use**

/**
 * Creates a scoped resource using an `acquire` and `release` effect.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function helps manage resources by combining two `Effect` values: one
 * for acquiring the resource and one for releasing it.
 *
 * `acquireRelease` does the following:
 *
 *   1. Ensures that the effect that acquires the resource will not be
 *      interrupted. Note that acquisition may still fail due to internal
 *      reasons (such as an uncaught exception).
 *   2. Ensures that the `release` effect will not be interrupted, and will be
 *      executed as long as the acquisition effect successfully acquires the
 *      resource.
 *
 * If the `acquire` function succeeds, the `release` function is added to the
 * list of finalizers for the scope. This ensures that the release will happen
 * automatically when the scope is closed.
 *
 * Both `acquire` and `release` run uninterruptibly, meaning they cannot be
 * interrupted while they are executing.
 *
 * Additionally, the `release` function can be influenced by the exit value when
 * the scope closes, allowing for custom handling of how the resource is
 * released based on the execution outcome.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * This function is used to ensure that an effect that represents the
 * acquisition of a resource (for example, opening a file, launching a thread,
 * etc.) will not be interrupted, and that the resource will always be released
 * when the `Effect` completes execution.
 *
 * **Example** (Defining a Simple Resource)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Define an interface for a resource
 * interface MyResource {
 *   readonly contents: string
 *   readonly close: () => Promise<void>

 * Guarantees that a cleanup function runs regardless of whether the effect

 * **Details**
 *
 * This function ensures that a provided cleanup function is executed after the
 * effect completes, regardless of the outcome. The cleanup function is given

 * result:
 * - If the effect succeeds, the `Exit` contains the success value.
 * - If the effect fails, the `Exit` contains the error or failure cause.
 * - If the effect is interrupted, the `Exit` reflects the interruption.
 *
 * The cleanup function is guaranteed to run uninterruptibly, ensuring reliable
 * resource management even in complex or high-concurrency scenarios.
 *
 * **Example** (Running a Cleanup Function with the Effect’s Result)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Console, Effect, Exit } from "effect"
 *
 * // Define a cleanup effect that logs the result
 * const handler = Effect.onExit((exit) =>

 * Ensures that finalizers are run concurrently when the scope of an effect is

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function modifies the behavior of finalizers within a scoped workflow to

 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Running finalizers concurrently can improve performance when multiple
 * independent cleanup tasks need to be performed. However, it requires that
 * these tasks do not depend on the order of execution or introduce race
 * conditions.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts

 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Console.log("Finalizer 1 executed").pipe(Effect.delay("300 millis")))

 *   yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Console.log("Finalizer 3 executed").pipe(Effect.delay("200 millis")))

 *
 * // Modify the program to ensure finalizers run in parallel
 * const modified = program.pipe(Effect.parallelFinalizers)

/**
 * Creates a new fiber to run an effect concurrently.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function takes an effect and forks it into a separate fiber, allowing it
 * to run concurrently without blocking the original effect. The new fiber
 * starts execution immediately after being created, and the fiber object is
 * returned immediately without waiting for the effect to begin. This is useful
 * when you want to run tasks concurrently while continuing other tasks in the
 * parent fiber.
 *
 * The forked fiber is attached to the parent fiber's scope. This means that
 * when the parent fiber terminates, the child fiber will also be terminated
 * automatically. This feature, known as "auto supervision," ensures that no
 * fibers are left running unintentionally. If you prefer not to have this auto
 * supervision behavior, you can use {@link forkDaemon} or {@link forkIn}.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you need to run an effect concurrently without
 * blocking the current execution flow. For example, you might use it to launch
 * background tasks or concurrent computations. However, working with fibers can
 * be complex, so before using this function directly, you might want to explore
 * higher-level functions like {@link raceWith}, {@link zip}, or others that can
 * manage concurrency for you.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const fib = (n: number): Effect.Effect<number> =>
 *   n < 2
 *     ? Effect.succeed(n)
 *     : Effect.zipWith(fib(n - 1), fib(n - 2), (a, b) => a + b)

/**
 * Forks a fiber in a local scope, ensuring it outlives its parent.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function is used to create fibers that are tied to a local scope,

 * they will continue running until the scope they were created in is closed.
 * This is particularly useful when you need a fiber to run independently of the

 * terminates. With `forkScoped`, the child fiber will keep running until the

 *
 * This function allows you to supply a specific implementation for a service

 * you link the service to its concrete implementation, enabling the effect to
 * execute successfully without additional requirements.
 *
 * For example, you can use this function to provide a random number generator,
 * a logger, or any other service your effect depends on. Once the service is
 * provided, all parts of the effect that rely on the service will automatically
 * use the implementation you supplied.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts

 * // Declaring a tag for a service that generates random numbers
 * class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<

   * 1. Start the do simulation using the `Do` value
   * 2. Within the do simulation scope, you can use the `bind` function to define variables and bind them to `Effect` values
   * 3. You can accumulate multiple `bind` statements to define multiple variables within the scope
   * 4. Inside the do simulation scope, you can also use the `let` function to define variables and bind them to simple values
   *
   * **Example**
   *
   * ```ts
   * import * as assert from "node:assert"
   * import { Effect, pipe } from "effect"
   *
   * const result = pipe(
   *   Effect.Do,
   *   Effect.bind("x", () => Effect.succeed(2)),
   *   Effect.bind("y", () => Effect.succeed(3)),
   *   Effect.let("sum", ({ x, y }) => x + y)
   * )
   * assert.deepStrictEqual(Effect.runSync(result), { x: 2, y: 3, sum: 5 })
   *
   * ```

 * **Details**

 * the effect fails, the failure is converted to `Option.none`.
 *
 * This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to represent the

 * The resulting effect has an error type of `never`, meaning it cannot fail
 * directly. However, unrecoverable errors, also referred to as defects, are
 * not captured and will still result in failure.
 *
 * **Example** (Using Effect.option to Handle Errors)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const maybe1 = Effect.option(Effect.succeed(1))
 *
 * Effect.runPromiseExit(maybe1).then(console.log)

 *
 * const maybe2 = Effect.option(Effect.fail("Uh oh!"))

/**
 * Encapsulates both success and failure of an `Effect` into an `Either` type.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function converts an effect that may fail into an effect that always
 * succeeds, wrapping the outcome in an `Either` type. The result will be
 * `Either.Left` if the effect fails, containing the recoverable error, or
 * `Either.Right` if it succeeds, containing the result.
 *
 * Using this function, you can handle recoverable errors explicitly without
 * causing the effect to fail. This is particularly useful in scenarios where
 * you want to chain effects and manage both success and failure in the same
 * logical flow.
 *
 * It's important to note that unrecoverable errors, often referred to as
 * "defects," are still thrown and not captured within the `Either` type. Only
 * failures that are explicitly represented as recoverable errors in the effect
 * are encapsulated.
 *
 * The resulting effect cannot fail directly because all recoverable failures
 * are represented inside the `Either` type.

 * // Example Output:
 * // { _id: 'Option', _tag: 'Some', value: 8609104974198840 }
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link when} for a version that allows the condition to be a boolean.

/**
 * Chains effects to produce new `Effect` instances, useful for combining
 * operations that depend on previous results.
 *
 * **Syntax**
 *
 * ```ts skip-type-checking
 * const flatMappedEffect = pipe(myEffect, Effect.flatMap(transformation))
 * // or
 * const flatMappedEffect = Effect.flatMap(myEffect, transformation)
 * // or
 * const flatMappedEffect = myEffect.pipe(Effect.flatMap(transformation))
 * ```
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * `flatMap` lets you sequence effects so that the result of one effect can be
 * used in the next step. It is similar to `flatMap` used with arrays but works
 * specifically with `Effect` instances, allowing you to avoid deeply nested
 * effect structures.
 *
 * Since effects are immutable, `flatMap` always returns a new effect instead of
 * changing the original one.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use `flatMap` when you need to chain multiple effects, ensuring that each
 * step produces a new `Effect` while flattening any nested effects that may
 * occur.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { pipe, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Function to apply a discount safely to a transaction amount
 * const applyDiscount = (
 *   total: number,
 *   discountRate: number
 * ): Effect.Effect<number, Error> =>
 *   discountRate === 0
 *     ? Effect.fail(new Error("Discount rate cannot be zero"))
 *     : Effect.succeed(total - (total * discountRate) / 100)
 *
 * // Simulated asynchronous task to fetch a transaction amount from database
 * const fetchTransactionAmount = Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(100))
 *
 * // Chaining the fetch and discount application using `flatMap`
 * const finalAmount = pipe(
 *   fetchTransactionAmount,
 *   Effect.flatMap((amount) => applyDiscount(amount, 5))

 * const transformedEffect = Effect.andThen(myEffect, anotherEffect)
 * // or
 * const transformedEffect = myEffect.pipe(Effect.andThen(anotherEffect))
 * ```
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use `andThen` when you need to run multiple actions in sequence, with the
 * second action depending on the result of the first. This is useful for
 * combining effects or handling computations that must happen in order.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The second action can be:

 * - A constant value (similar to {@link as})
 * - A function returning a value (similar to {@link map})
 * - A `Promise`
 * - A function returning a `Promise`
 * - An `Effect`
 * - A function returning an `Effect` (similar to {@link flatMap})
 *
 * **Note:** `andThen` works well with both `Option` and `Either` types,
 * treating them as effects.

/**
 * Races two effects and returns the result of the first successful one.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function takes two effects and runs them concurrently. The first effect
 * that successfully completes will determine the result of the race, and the
 * other effect will be interrupted.
 *
 * If neither effect succeeds, the function will fail with a `Cause`
 * containing all the errors.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * This is useful when you want to run two effects concurrently, but only care
 * about the first one to succeed. It is commonly used in cases like timeouts,
 * retries, or when you want to optimize for the faster response without
 * worrying about the other effect.
 *
 * **Handling Success or Failure with Either**
 *
 * If you want to handle the result of whichever task completes first, whether
 * it succeeds or fails, you can use the `Effect.either` function. This function
 * wraps the result in an `Either` type, allowing you to see if the result
 * was a success (`Right`) or a failure (`Left`).
 *
 * **Example** (Both Tasks Succeed)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"

 *
 * const program = Effect.race(task1, task2)
 *
 * Effect.runFork(program)
 * // Output:

 * **Disconnecting Effects**
 *
 * The `Effect.raceFirst` function safely interrupts the “loser” effect once the other completes, but it will not resume until the loser is cleanly terminated.

 * If you want a quicker return, you can disconnect the interrupt signal for both effects. Instead of calling:

 * ```ts skip-type-checking

/**
 * Runs a side effect with the result of an effect without changing the original
 * value.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function works similarly to `flatMap`, but it ignores the result of the
 * function passed to it. The value from the previous effect remains available
 * for the next part of the chain. Note that if the side effect fails, the
 * entire chain will fail too.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you want to perform a side effect, like logging or
 * tracking, without modifying the main value. This is useful when you need to
 * observe or record an action but want the original value to be passed to the
 * next step.
 *
 * **Example** (Logging a step in a pipeline)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Console, Effect, pipe } from "effect"
 *
 * // Function to apply a discount safely to a transaction amount
 * const applyDiscount = (
 *   total: number,
 *   discountRate: number
 * ): Effect.Effect<number, Error> =>
 *   discountRate === 0
 *     ? Effect.fail(new Error("Discount rate cannot be zero"))
 *     : Effect.succeed(total - (total * discountRate) / 100)
 *
 * // Simulated asynchronous task to fetch a transaction amount from database
 * const fetchTransactionAmount = Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(100))
 *
 * const finalAmount = pipe(
 *   fetchTransactionAmount,
 *   // Log the fetched transaction amount
 *   Effect.tap((amount) => Console.log(`Apply a discount to: ${amount}`)),

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function is specifically designed to handle and inspect defects, which

 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts

 * // Simulate a task that fails with a recoverable error
 * const task1: Effect.Effect<number, string> = Effect.fail("NetworkError")

 *
 * ```ts skip-type-checking
 * let result = initial
 *
 * while (options.while(result)) {
 *   result = options.body(result)
 * }
 *
 * return result
 * ```
 *
 * It starts with an initial state, checks a
 * condition (`while`), and executes a body operation to update the state if the
 * condition evaluates to `true`. The process repeats until the condition
 * returns `false`.
 *
 * The state is passed between iterations, allowing the body operation to modify
 * it dynamically. The final state after the loop ends is returned as the result
 * of the effect.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * This is particularly useful for scenarios where looping logic involves
 * asynchronous or side-effectful operations, such as polling or iterative

/**
 * Repeatedly executes a loop with a state, collecting results or discarding
 * them based on configuration.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function performs an effectful loop, starting with an initial state and
 * iterating as long as the `while` condition evaluates to `true`, similar to a
 * `while` loop in JavaScript.
 *
 * ```ts skip-type-checking
 * let state = initial
 * const result = []
 *
 * while (options.while(state)) {
 *   result.push(options.body(state)) // Perform the effectful operation
 *   state = options.step(state) // Update the state
 * }
 *
 * return result
 * ```
 *
 * During each iteration, the `step` function updates the state, and the `body`
 * effect is executed.
 *
 * The results of the body effect can be collected in an array or discarded
 * based on the `discard` option.
 *
 * **Discarding Intermediate Results**
 *
 * - If `discard` is `false` or not provided, the intermediate results are
 *   collected into an array and returned as the final result.
 * - If `discard` is `true`, the intermediate results are ignored, and the
 *   effect returns `void`.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * This is useful for implementing loops where you need to perform effectful
 * computations repeatedly, such as processing items in a list, generating
 * values, or performing iterative updates.
 *
 * **Example** (Looping with Collected Results)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // A loop that runs 5 times, collecting each iteration's result
 * const result = Effect.loop(
 *   // Initial state

 *     body: (state) => Effect.succeed(state)
 *   }
 * )
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(result).then(console.log)

 * **Details**
 *
 * This function executes an effect repeatedly according to the given schedule.
 * Each repetition occurs after the initial execution of the effect, meaning
 * that the schedule determines the number of additional repetitions. For
 * example, using `Schedule.once` will result in the effect being executed twice
 * (once initially and once as part of the repetition).
 *
 * If the effect succeeds, it is repeated according to the schedule. If it
 * fails, the repetition stops immediately, and the failure is returned.
 *
 * The schedule can also specify delays between repetitions, making it useful
 * for tasks like retrying operations with backoff, periodic execution, or
 * performing a series of dependent actions.
 *
 * You can combine schedules for more advanced repetition logic, such as adding
 * delays, limiting recursions, or dynamically adjusting based on the outcome of
 * each execution.
 *
 * **Example** (Success Example)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Schedule, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const action = Console.log("success")
 * const policy = Schedule.addDelay(Schedule.recurs(2), () => "100 millis")
 * const program = Effect.repeat(action, policy)
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(program).then((n) => console.log(`repetitions: ${n}`))
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Failure Example)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Schedule } from "effect"
 *
 * let count = 0
 *
 * // Define an async effect that simulates an action with possible failures
 * const action = Effect.async<string, string>((resume) => {
 *   if (count > 1) {
 *     console.log("failure")
 *     resume(Effect.fail("Uh oh!"))
 *   } else {
 *     count++
 *     console.log("success")
 *     resume(Effect.succeed("yay!"))
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * const policy = Schedule.addDelay(Schedule.recurs(2), () => "100 millis")
 * const program = Effect.repeat(action, policy)
 *
 * Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then(console.log)

/**
 * Repeats an effect with a schedule, handling failures using a custom handler.

 * **Details**
 *
 * This function allows you to execute an effect repeatedly based on a specified

 * of the schedule at the time of failure. This enables advanced error recovery
 * or alternative fallback logic while maintaining flexibility in how
 * repetitions are handled.
 *
 * For example, using a schedule with `recurs(2)` will allow for two additional
 * repetitions after the initial execution, provided the effect succeeds. If a
 * failure occurs during any iteration, the failure handler is invoked to handle
 * the situation.

 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Schedule } from "effect"
 *
 * let count = 0
 *
 * // Define an async effect that simulates an action with possible failures

 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you need to run an effect in the background,

 *
 * **Important**: Attempting to run effects that involve asynchronous operations

 * - You need a direct, synchronous result from the effect.
 * - You are working within a context where asynchronous effects are not

/**
 * Combines two effects into a single effect, producing a tuple of their

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function combines two effects, `self` and `that`, into one. It executes
 * the first effect (`self`) and then the second effect (`that`), collecting
 * their results into a tuple. Both effects must succeed for the resulting
 * effect to succeed. If either effect fails, the entire operation fails.
 *
 * By default, the effects are executed sequentially. If the `concurrent` option
 * is set to `true`, the effects will run concurrently, potentially improving
 * performance for independent operations.
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Two Effects Sequentially)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const task1 = Effect.succeed(1).pipe(
 *   Effect.delay("200 millis"),
 *   Effect.tap(Effect.log("task1 done"))
 * )
 * const task2 = Effect.succeed("hello").pipe(
 *   Effect.delay("100 millis"),
 *   Effect.tap(Effect.log("task2 done"))
 * )
 *
 * // Combine the two effects together
 * //
 * //      ┌─── Effect<[number, string], never, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const program = Effect.zip(task1, task2)
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // timestamp=... level=INFO fiber=#0 message="task1 done"
 * // timestamp=... level=INFO fiber=#0 message="task2 done"
 * // [ 1, 'hello' ]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Combining Two Effects Concurrently)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const task1 = Effect.succeed(1).pipe(
 *   Effect.delay("200 millis"),
 *   Effect.tap(Effect.log("task1 done"))
 * )
 * const task2 = Effect.succeed("hello").pipe(

/**
 * Safely handles nullable values by creating an effect that fails for `null` or
 * `undefined`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function ensures that an input value is non-null and non-undefined
 * before processing it. If the value is valid, the effect succeeds with the
 * value. If the value is `null` or `undefined`, the effect fails with a
 * `NoSuchElementException`. This is particularly useful for avoiding
 * null-related errors by clearly separating valid values from invalid ones in
 * effectful computations.
 *
 * The failure with `NoSuchElementException` allows you to explicitly handle
 * cases where a value is expected but not provided, leading to safer and more
 * predictable code.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when working with values that may be `null` or `undefined`
 * and you want to ensure that only non-null values are processed. It helps
 * enforce null-safety and makes error handling more explicit.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<number, NoSuchElementException, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const maybe1 = Effect.fromNullable(1)
 *
 * Effect.runPromiseExit(maybe1).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // { _id: 'Exit', _tag: 'Success', value: 1 }
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<number, NoSuchElementException, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const maybe2 = Effect.fromNullable(null as number | null)
 *
 * Effect.runPromiseExit(maybe2).then(console.log)
 * // Output:
 * // {
 * //   _id: 'Exit',
 * //   _tag: 'Failure',
 * //   cause: {
 * //     _id: 'Cause',
 * //     _tag: 'Fail',
 * //     failure: { _tag: 'NoSuchElementException' }
 * //   }
 * // }

/**
 * Converts an effect that may fail with a `NoSuchElementException` into an
 * effect that succeeds with an `Option`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function transforms an effect that might fail with
 * `Cause.NoSuchElementException` into an effect that succeeds with an `Option`
 * type. If the original effect succeeds, its value is wrapped in `Option.some`.
 * If it fails specifically due to a `NoSuchElementException`, the failure is
 * mapped to `Option.none`. Other types of failures remain unchanged and are
 * passed through as they are.
 *
 * This is useful when working with effects where you want to gracefully handle
 * the absence of a value while preserving other potential failures.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function when you need to handle missing values as `Option.none`
 * rather than throwing or propagating errors like `NoSuchElementException`.
 * It’s ideal for scenarios where you want to explicitly represent optionality
 * in a type-safe way while retaining other failure information.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<number, NoSuchElementException, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const maybe1 = Effect.fromNullable(1)
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<Option<number>, never, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const option1 = Effect.optionFromOptional(maybe1)
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(option1).then(console.log)
 * // Output: { _id: 'Option', _tag: 'Some', value: 1 }
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<number, NoSuchElementException, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const maybe2 = Effect.fromNullable(null as number | null)
 *
 * //      ┌─── Effect<Option<number>, never, never>
 * //      ▼
 * const option2 = Effect.optionFromOptional(maybe2)

 * This function allows you to streamline the creation of services by combining
 * the definition of a `Context.Tag` and a `Layer` in a single step. It supports
 * various ways of providing the service implementation:
 * - Using an `effect` to define the service dynamically.
 * - Using `sync` or `succeed` to define the service statically.
 * - Using `scoped` to create services with lifecycle management.
 *
 * It also allows you to specify dependencies for the service, which will be
 * provided automatically when the service is used. Accessors can be optionally
 * generated for the service, making it more convenient to use.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from 'effect';
 *
 * class Prefix extends Effect.Service<Prefix>()("Prefix", {
 *  sync: () => ({ prefix: "PRE" })

/**
 * The `Effect.fn` function allows you to create traced functions that return an
 * effect. It provides two key features:
 *
 * - **Stack traces with location details** if an error occurs.
 * - **Automatic span creation** for tracing when a span name is provided.
 *
 * If a span name is passed as the first argument, the function's execution is
 * tracked using that name. If no name is provided, stack tracing still works,
 * but spans are not created.
 *
 * A function can be defined using either:
 *
 * - A generator function, allowing the use of `yield*` for effect composition.
 * - A regular function that returns an `Effect`.
 *
 * **Example** (Creating a Traced Function with a Span Name)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const myfunc = Effect.fn("myspan")(function* <N extends number>(n: N) {
 *   yield* Effect.annotateCurrentSpan("n", n) // Attach metadata to the span
 *   console.log(`got: ${n}`)
 *   yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Boom!")) // Simulate failure
 * })
 *
 * Effect.runFork(myfunc(100).pipe(Effect.catchAllCause(Effect.logError)))
 * // Output:
 * // got: 100
 * // timestamp=... level=ERROR fiber=#0 cause="Error: Boom!
 * //     at <anonymous> (/.../index.ts:6:22) <= Raise location
 * //     at myspan (/.../index.ts:3:23)  <= Definition location
 * //     at myspan (/.../index.ts:9:16)" <= Call location
 * ```
 *
 * `Effect.fn` automatically creates spans. The spans capture information about
 * the function execution, including metadata and error details.
 *
 * **Example** (Exporting Spans to the Console)
 *
 * ```ts skip-type-checking
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { NodeSdk } from "@effect/opentelemetry"
 * import {
 *   ConsoleSpanExporter,
 *   BatchSpanProcessor
 * } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base"
 *
 * const myfunc = Effect.fn("myspan")(function* <N extends number>(n: N) {
 *   yield* Effect.annotateCurrentSpan("n", n)
 *   console.log(`got: ${n}`)
 *   yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Boom!"))
 * })
 *
 * const program = myfunc(100)
 *
 * const NodeSdkLive = NodeSdk.layer(() => ({
 *   resource: { serviceName: "example" },
 *   // Export span data to the console
 *   spanProcessor: new BatchSpanProcessor(new ConsoleSpanExporter())
 * }))
 *
 * Effect.runFork(program.pipe(Effect.provide(NodeSdkLive)))
 * // Output:
 * // got: 100
 * // {
 * //   resource: {
 * //     attributes: {
 * //       'service.name': 'example',
 * //       'telemetry.sdk.language': 'nodejs',
 * //       'telemetry.sdk.name': '@effect/opentelemetry',
 * //       'telemetry.sdk.version': '1.30.1'
 * //     }
 * //   },
 * //   instrumentationScope: { name: 'example', version: undefined, schemaUrl: undefined },

 * //   id: '7af530c1e01bc0cb',
 * //   kind: 0,
 * //   timestamp: 1741182277518402.2,
 * //   duration: 4300.416,
 * //   attributes: {
 * //     n: 100,
 * //     'code.stacktrace': 'at <anonymous> (/.../index.ts:8:23)\n' +
 * //       'at <anonymous> (/.../index.ts:14:17)'
 * //   },
 * //   status: { code: 2, message: 'Boom!' },
 * //   events: [
 * //     {
 * //       name: 'exception',
 * //       attributes: {
 * //         'exception.type': 'Error',
 * //         'exception.message': 'Boom!',
 * //         'exception.stacktrace': 'Error: Boom!\n' +
 * //           '    at <anonymous> (/.../index.ts:11:22)\n' +
 * //           '    at myspan (/.../index.ts:8:23)\n' +
 * //           '    at myspan (/.../index.ts:14:17)'
 * //       },
 * //       time: [ 1741182277, 522702583 ],
 * //       droppedAttributesCount: 0
 * //     }
 * //   ],
 * //   links: []
 * // }
 * ```
 *
 * `Effect.fn` also acts as a pipe function, allowing you to create a pipeline
 * after the function definition using the effect returned by the generator
 * function as the starting value of the pipeline.
 *
 * **Example** (Creating a Traced Function with a Delay)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * const myfunc = Effect.fn(
 *   function* (n: number) {
 *     console.log(`got: ${n}`)
 *     yield* Effect.fail(new Error("Boom!"))
 *   },
 *   // You can access both the created effect and the original arguments
 *   (effect, n) => Effect.delay(effect, `${n / 100} seconds`)
 * )
 *
 * Effect.runFork(myfunc(100).pipe(Effect.catchAllCause(Effect.logError)))
 * // Output:
 * // got: 100
 * // timestamp=... level=ERROR fiber=#0 cause="Error: Boom! (<= after 1 second)
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link fnUntraced} for a version of this function that doesn't add a span.
 *
 * @since 3.11.0
