/**
 * Low-level helpers for adapting push-based SQL row sources into Effect
 * streams.
 *
 * SQL drivers often expose large query results through cursors, event emitters,
 * or driver-specific streams that push rows as they arrive. This module
 * provides the small interop layer used by SQL integrations to turn those
 * producers into `Stream` values for `Statement.stream` and
 * `Connection.executeStream`, so callers can process large result sets
 * incrementally instead of materializing every row in memory.
