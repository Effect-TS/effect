 * **Details**
 *
 * `decodeEffect` is required for complete decoding and detailed failures. `decode`,

 * The interpreter supplies only `decodeEffect` in this same format.
 * An optional `makeEffect` supplies complete node construction. Otherwise the
 * registry prepares and caches the interpreted constructor, never the decoder,
 * for that operation. Public makers resolve the schema's exact type-side AST.
 *
 * The registry wraps these operations in an internal entry.
 * Decoding tries `decode` when present, returning its output on success or
 * calling `decodeEffect` after `invalid`. Without `decode`, or for the {@link missing}
 * sentinel, it calls `decodeEffect` directly. Type guards prefer `is`; otherwise
 * they use ordinary decoding with the same fast-path/diagnostic fallback.
 * A boolean `false` from `is` needs no diagnostic replay.
 * Synchronous decoding and encoding share an adapter that returns successful
 * `decode` output directly, without wrapping it in an intermediate Effect.
 * Each operation is resolved lazily on first use, so unused fast paths need
 * not be compiled.
 * Synchronous construction tries `make` when present, returning its output on
 * success or calling `makeEffect` after {@link invalid}. Compilers must omit
 * `make` when replay could repeat observable construction work. Construction
 * never uses `is` or `decode`. Field/element defaults belong to the parent
 * occurrence, not to the root node or a Union member.
 * Runtime options apply to construction too; Union candidate selection preserves
 * the constructor's conservative handling of absent discriminants.
