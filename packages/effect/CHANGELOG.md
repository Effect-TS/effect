## 4.0.0-beta.99

### Patch Changes

- [#6397](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/6397) [`8ce4795`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/commit/8ce4795ccbaebca4292757db568c005a992546a4) Thanks @IMax153! - Add a scoped `CliConfig` service for customizing the built-in global flags used by CLI command runners.

  For example, provide an explicit list that omits `GlobalFlag.LogLevel` to remove the built-in `--log-level` flag:

  ```ts
  import { Effect } from "effect";
  import { CliConfig, Command, GlobalFlag } from "effect/unstable/cli";

  const program = Command.run(command, { version: "1.0.0" }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(
      CliConfig.layer({
        builtIns: [GlobalFlag.Help, GlobalFlag.Version, GlobalFlag.Completions],
      }),
    ),
  );
  ```

- [#6394](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/6394) [`88a54cc`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/commit/88a54cc341006e3ebcb13482c618f62a680ce199) Thanks @lloydrichards! - add a `radius` option to `Graph` search configuration, allowing `dfs`, `bfs`, and `dfsPostOrder` traversals to limit returned nodes by edge distance from the configured start nodes. Traversals can also use `direction: "undirected"` to follow edges in either direction.

- [#6457](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/6457) [`e6e6dba`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/commit/e6e6dba6e9d86e7c2ad27dcedf289db76a19697f) Thanks @fubhy! - Improve `Graph.dijkstra` and `Graph.astar` priority queue performance.

  - Export a `Command.Services` utility type to extract the required services from a `Command`

- [#6462](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/6462) [`bddb010`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/commit/bddb010eac3d4436cb094edbbee7460c5440c162) Thanks @fubhy! - Fix immutable Graph equality and hashing to include future node and edge identifier allocation.

- [#6371](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/6371) [`7543afe`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/commit/7543afea6f4d97d1f1ad876224323838a48daadd) Thanks @polRk! - Tool: preserve the tool kind when cloning provider-defined and dynamic tools.

  `Tool.addDependency`, `setParameters`, `setSuccess`, `setFailure`, `annotate`, and `annotateMerge` previously rebuilt the tool as a user-defined tool, which flipped `Tool.isProviderDefined` to `false`, corrupted the provider `id` (e.g. `anthropic.memory_20250818`), and crashed `Tool.getStrictMode`. These operations now clone the tool while preserving its prototype, `id`, and kind. Provider-defined tools also now carry an empty annotations context so `Tool.getStrictMode`/`annotate` work on them. Closes [#2615](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/issues/2615).

- [#6421](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/6421) [`44b9cf3`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/commit/44b9cf3d240d726997b4bbcd0ede48e074d3c456) Thanks @fubhy! - Preserve null edge data in Graph.floydWarshall costs.

- [#6394](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/6394) [`88a54cc`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/commit/88a54cc341006e3ebcb13482c618f62a680ce199) Thanks @lloydrichards! - added graph set operations for combining and comparing graphs

## 4.0.0-beta.98

### Patch Changes

- [#2587](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2587) [`989603b`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/989603b60ab1197b64acf214208e0d370cd1f842) Thanks @gcanti! - Expose `SchemaError` as a public module and re-export `Schema.isSchemaError`.

  This gives consumers a stable import path and guard for schema failures without
  depending on the internal schema implementation, while preserving the existing
  `Schema.SchemaError` surface.

- [#2592](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2592) [`214c458`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/214c458084bb6995d543cd37d1055f24be3d454e) Thanks @gcanti! - Apply `transformClient` when building an individual HttpApi endpoint client, preserving the supplied client's error and service channels.

- [#2598](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2598) [`a037273`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/a0372736ac34796969b051bbba4717d7983f1ebe) Thanks @gcanti! - Preserve `__proto__` group and endpoint identifiers in HTTP APIs, generated clients, and URL builders.

- [#2578](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2578) [`97fdaa9`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/97fdaa9c1f522c65e579365d314a07878e2b904f) Thanks @tim-smart! - Fix `Atom.kvs` async mode to retain its `AsyncResult` value shape after writes.

- [#2612](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2612) [`b24d248`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/b24d248c8df44222ce642087cde2bd859a2dc709) Thanks @gptguy! - Fix replay of persisted `DurableDeferred.raceAll` results.

- [#2580](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2580) [`19c222c`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/19c222cac2353a3d7b7733caecb00556fffe9a5c) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix HttpApi authorization decoding.

  Previously, `HttpApiBuilder.securityDecode` removed the expected scheme length and one following character from the `Authorization` header without verifying either value. A Bearer decoder could therefore pass credentials from a different scheme such as `Basic`, accept a malformed header without a separating space, or retain leading spaces when more than one separator was present.

  The decoder now validates the declared scheme before returning credentials, matches it case-insensitively as required by [RFC 9110 section 11.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-11.1), and consumes one or more separating spaces. Missing, malformed, or mismatched headers produce the existing empty credential value so security middleware can reject them consistently.

  Basic authentication previously split the decoded `user-pass` value at every colon, causing otherwise valid passwords containing `:` to be discarded. It now uses only the first colon as the separator and preserves the rest of the password, following [RFC 7617 section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7617.html#section-2).

- [#2581](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2581) [`eec85dd`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/eec85ddba09ea326fd268ee33eeffd47e50d4671) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix HttpApi client error decoding.

  Generated clients previously combined every error schema for a status into one union decoder. When schemas used different encodings, their declaration order could determine the decoded error instead of the response `Content-Type`; for example, a text decoder could accept a JSON response before the JSON decoder was tried.

  Error responses are now grouped and selected by normalized content type, matching buffered success responses. Normalization happens before grouping, so declarations that differ only by casing or parameters such as `charset` share one union decoder instead of making later schemas unreachable.

  No-content schemas are represented by a headerless alternative, allowing empty error responses without a `Content-Type` header to decode correctly. Unsupported content types preserve the existing combination of `StatusCodeError` and the response decoding failure.

- [#2605](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2605) [`0082f4f`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/0082f4f74fb139fd578f87f0a790e845133983dc) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix `Number.remainder` for very small and large values formatted in scientific notation.

- [#2611](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2611) [`8849052`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/884905232d1e9a365e046d8dde27bf9c5707f57f) Thanks @tim-smart! - Fix `PersistedQueue` to count schema decoding and malformed SQL payload failures as processing attempts.

- [#2500](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2500) [`c15e16a`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/c15e16ad130d1fbde25d912b7ac55995066cb35b) Thanks @hsubra89! - Fix Redis-backed `PersistedQueue` reset and failed-item handling.

- [#2602](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2602) [`01d00a3`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/01d00a3abfbf1f37996cdbe738ea5137c646cdd7) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix a bug where decoding bracket paths from FormData or URLSearchParams could mutate inherited object prototypes.

- [#2588](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2588) [`8bd4589`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/8bd458975a1b3a8ed042eccf317b93d28ded91e7) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix `SchemaAST.isJson` to reject class instances and other non-record objects.

- [#2605](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2605) [`0082f4f`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/0082f4f74fb139fd578f87f0a790e845133983dc) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix JSON Schema `allOf` imports for tuple intersections and preserve primitive refinements when combining literal constraints.

- [#2604](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2604) [`6e08428`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/6e08428d980501b856f846ad3f3f0e4ea46e7786) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix `Schema.toFormatter` and `Schema.toEquivalence` indexing for tuples with multiple post-rest elements.

- [#2603](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2603) [`388dcf9`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/388dcf953f65d317547f34d40e6443c5f264205f) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix union candidate selection and decoding order so that unions now:
  - consider matches from every sentinel key instead of dropping valid members after the first match;
  - reject ambiguous `oneOf` inputs when members with different sentinel keys both match;
  - preserve declared member order when combining discriminated members with non-discriminated fallbacks;
  - commit concurrent decoding results in declaration order instead of completion order.

  Reserved SSE failure event names with non-`Cause` data are now emitted as application events instead of producing a runtime defect.

- [#2609](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2609) [`2b7ce2b`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/2b7ce2b513e7ec2a77822f1116dc6ffb6ba93f4e) Thanks @tim-smart! - Fix SQL-backed persisted queues to refresh locks for actively acquired elements.

- [#2583](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2583) [`87bea7e`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/87bea7e16259246f3bcdf565446394751abca953) Thanks @MrGovindan! - Fixed Clock.sleep handling of large durations

- [#2582](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2582) [`ce38dc3`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/ce38dc33bda805a684432cca071f4dc3c6b9a1ba) Thanks @gcanti! - Harden HttpApi documentation HTML rendering.

  Scalar descriptions and CDN versions were interpolated without attribute-safe escaping. Embedded OpenAPI JSON in Scalar and Swagger also handled only the exact `</script>` sequence, not other valid [script end-tag forms](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#script-data-end-tag-name-state).

  Attribute values and CDN versions are now encoded for their contexts, and embedded JSON escapes `<` so it cannot close its script element.

- [#2591](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2591) [`a807cd1`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/a807cd170341deca8a1cfb52c4222585f2431bb9) Thanks @gcanti! - Keep HttpApi composition immutable.

  `HttpApi.addHttpApi` applied annotations from the added API by mutating its shared groups. It now creates annotated group copies, keeping the source API and independently annotated variants unchanged while preserving annotation precedence.

- [#2584](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2584) [`fd8a356`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/fd8a356f06a8c9ce4e7e0a13fc4021c178ed31de) Thanks @gcanti! - Normalize HttpApi payload media types.

  Payload schemas were stored under their exact declared `Content-Type`, but the server lowercased the incoming header and removed its parameters before looking it up. For example, a schema declared as `Application/Vnd.Effect+JSON; profile=declared` was stored under that value, while the server looked for `application/vnd.effect+json`. This could produce a `415` response even when the generated client and server used the same API.

  The same mismatch allowed incompatible encodings for equivalent media types to bypass validation. Generated form-urlencoded requests also ignored custom content types and always used the default one.

  Payload maps now use normalized keys for matching and conflict checks, while each encoding keeps its declared content type. Generated requests and OpenAPI use the declared values, including every parameterized variant, and custom form-urlencoded content types are preserved.

- [#2476](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2476) [`c2a5edc`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/c2a5edc3abd31ad5bc123362bc1213e03e4095c3) Thanks @gcanti! - Improve unstable `HttpApi` type-level performance.

  The implementation now uses identifier-keyed maps and lighter structural
  constraints in several hot type-level paths. Generated group clients consume the
  concrete endpoint map directly instead of rebuilding it from the endpoint union.

  ## New Features
  - Add `HttpApiBuilder.Handlers.handleAll`, which registers an identifier-keyed batch of endpoint handlers for a group. Each entry can be either a handler function or `{ handler, options }`, and the object can be supplied in multiple partial batches. Endpoint identifiers that were already handled are rejected across batches.
  - `HttpApi.groups` now preserves the concrete group type for each group identifier. For example, `Api.groups.users` is typed as the `users` group instead of the full group union.
  - `HttpApiGroup.endpoints` now preserves the concrete endpoint type for each endpoint identifier. For example, `Group.endpoints.getUser` is typed as the `getUser` endpoint instead of the full endpoint union.
  - `HttpApiEndpoint` values can now be extended as classes, matching the class-like
    runtime shape already used by `HttpApi` and `HttpApiGroup`.

  ## Measured Type-Level Performance

  Main/current comparisons use identical generated fixtures compiled once per
  revision with TypeScript 7.0.2. The recorded revisions are `main` at
  `97fdaa9c1f52` and the branch source at `5798fc5fafcd`. The focused pre/post
  curves below were captured with the regular `httpapi` regression suite during
  development. The retained suite uses representative stress points instead of
  rerunning every point in those historical curves. All numbers are
  type-instantiation deltas over the corresponding shared baseline.

  Endpoint declaration costs now grow with a lower slope:

  | endpoints |    main | current |
  | --------: | ------: | ------: |
  |        10 |   4,580 |   2,808 |
  |        50 |  15,500 |   9,168 |
  |       100 |  29,150 |  17,118 |
  |       500 | 138,350 |  80,718 |

  Class-like endpoint declarations are slightly cheaper than inline endpoint
  values in the same 500-endpoint fixture shape:

  | fixture       | inline | class-like |
  | ------------- | -----: | ---------: |
  | 500 endpoints | 82,207 |     71,850 |

  `HttpApiBuilder` fluent handler registration avoids the previous non-linear
  blow-up in the cross-ref comparison:

  | fixture          |       main |   current |
  | ---------------- | ---------: | --------: |
  | 10 endpoints     |     37,856 |    11,582 |
  | 50 endpoints     |    568,576 |    63,702 |
  | 100 endpoints    |  2,154,476 |   182,852 |
  | 500 endpoints    | 51,741,676 | 3,296,052 |
  | 500 raw handlers | 51,734,176 | 3,294,550 |

  In the recorded regular-suite measurements, `handleAll` remains the scalable
  alternative to the equivalent fluent chain:

  | fixture              |    fluent | `handleAll` |
  | -------------------- | --------: | ----------: |
  | 10 endpoints         |    11,579 |       9,146 |
  | 50 endpoints         |    63,699 |      25,106 |
  | 100 endpoints        |   182,849 |      45,056 |
  | 500 endpoints        | 3,296,049 |     204,656 |
  | 500 eps, two batches | 3,296,049 |     223,613 |

  Generated-client type production also improves for the hot method-building
  paths:

  | fixture                                 |    main | current |
  | --------------------------------------- | ------: | ------: |
  | client methods, 500 endpoints           | 245,795 | 176,850 |
  | top-level client methods, 500 endpoints | 243,651 | 179,809 |
  | client endpoint method, 500 endpoints   |  56,738 |  46,294 |
  | client groups, 100 groups x 5 endpoints |  49,019 |  25,893 |

  The following focused curves were captured immediately before and after each
  isolated type-level change.

  The focused `Client.Group` curve shows the improvement from consuming the
  identifier-keyed endpoint map directly:

  | endpoints | union remapping | endpoint map |
  | --------: | --------------: | -----------: |
  |        10 |          12,448 |       12,294 |
  |        50 |          19,169 |       18,935 |
  |       100 |          27,570 |       27,236 |
  |       500 |          94,770 |       93,636 |

  The focused `Client.TopLevelMethods` curve improves by reading endpoint
  identifiers directly from the endpoint union:

  | endpoints | pre-change | post-change |
  | --------: | ---------: | ----------: |
  |        10 |     12,531 |      12,476 |
  |        50 |     19,252 |      19,197 |
  |       100 |     27,653 |      27,598 |
  |       500 |     94,853 |      94,798 |

  The focused `HttpApiClient.endpoint` selection curve improves by reading
  endpoint identifiers directly from the selected endpoint union:

  | endpoints | pre-change | post-change |
  | --------: | ---------: | ----------: |
  |        10 |      7,666 |       7,588 |
  |        50 |      8,707 |       8,629 |
  |       100 |     10,008 |       9,930 |
  |       500 |     20,408 |      20,330 |

  The focused `HttpApiBuilder.endpoint` selection curve improves by reading
  endpoint identifiers directly from the selected endpoint union:

  | endpoints | pre-change | post-change |
  | --------: | ---------: | ----------: |
  |        10 |     12,828 |      12,745 |
  |        50 |     13,869 |      13,786 |
  |       100 |     15,170 |      15,087 |
  |       500 |     25,570 |      25,487 |

  URL builder types now avoid repeatedly expanding the full API/group shape:

  | fixture                              |    main | current |
  | ------------------------------------ | ------: | ------: |
  | URL builder, 500 endpoints           | 211,356 |  91,610 |
  | top-level URL builder, 500 endpoints | 210,724 |  93,118 |
  | builder endpoint, 500 endpoints      |  62,894 |  51,952 |

  ## Breaking Changes

  These changes affect unstable `HttpApi` type-level APIs and structural API,
  group, and endpoint types.

  ### Renamed Constraint Types
  - Broad structural constraint exports have been renamed to align with
    `Schema.Constraint` terminology: `HttpApi.Any` to `HttpApi.Constraint`,
    `HttpApi.AnyWithProps` to `HttpApi.Top`, `HttpApiGroup.Any` to
    `HttpApiGroup.Constraint`, `HttpApiGroup.AnyWithProps` to `HttpApiGroup.Top`,
    and `HttpApiEndpoint.Any` to `HttpApiEndpoint.Constraint`.
  - `HttpApiEndpoint.AnyWithProps` has been replaced by `HttpApiEndpoint.Top`, whose
    schema parameters are constrained to `Schema.Top`, including success and error
    schemas.
  - Type guards now expose the widened runtime-prop shapes: `HttpApi.isHttpApi`
    returns `HttpApi.Top`, `HttpApiGroup.isHttpApiGroup` returns
    `HttpApiGroup.Top`, and `HttpApiEndpoint.isHttpApiEndpoint` returns
    `HttpApiEndpoint.Top`.
  - `HttpApiGroup.ApiGroup` has been renamed to `HttpApiGroup.Service`.

  ### API, Group, And Endpoint Shapes
  - `HttpApi.groups` is now typed as an identifier-keyed group map instead of
    `ReadonlyRecord<string, Groups>`, and `HttpApi` tracks its group union
    invariantly. Dynamic string indexing must refine the key first or cast to a
    broad runtime record.
  - `HttpApiGroup.endpoints` is now typed as an identifier-keyed endpoint map instead of
    `ReadonlyRecord<string, Endpoints>`, and `HttpApiGroup` tracks its endpoint
    union invariantly. Dynamic string indexing must refine the key first or cast to
    a broad runtime record.
  - `HttpApiEndpoint` now exposes its stable key as `identifier` instead of `name`,
    aligning endpoints with APIs and groups and leaving `name` available for future
    class-based endpoint patterns.
  - `HttpApiEndpoint` values are now function objects instead of plain objects.
    Runtime checks such as `typeof endpoint` now return `"function"`, and
    `endpoint.name` is the native function name. Use `endpoint.identifier` for the
    stable endpoint key.
  - Identifier helper types have been renamed from `Name` / `WithName` to
    `Identifier` / `WithIdentifier`; `HttpApiGroup.Service` now exposes
    `identifier` instead of `name`.

  ### Builder Handler Types
  - `HttpApiBuilder.Handlers` now tracks endpoints through an identifier-keyed endpoint map and a set of handled endpoint identifiers, instead of tracking the remaining endpoint union. Its public type parameters changed from `Handlers<R, Endpoints>` to `Handlers<R, EndpointsByIdentifier, HandledIdentifiers>`, and its phantom fields changed from `_Endpoints` to `~EndpointsByIdentifier` / `~HandledIdentifiers`.
  - The unused `HttpApiBuilder.Handlers.Any` helper type has been removed.
  - The exported `HttpApiBuilder.HandlersTypeId` symbol has been removed; `Handlers`
    now uses a private string type id.
  - Duplicate `handle` / `handleRaw` registrations for the same endpoint are rejected
    at the call site, and `handleAll` rejects endpoint identifiers that were already
    handled by an earlier batch. Missing endpoint handlers are still rejected by
    the final `HttpApiBuilder.group` return validation.

  ### Client Types
  - `HttpApiClient.Client.Group` now derives a client from a concrete group type: `Client.Group<Group, E, R>`. The previous group-union plus group-identifier form is no longer supported.
  - `HttpApiClient.Client.TopLevelMethods` now returns an identifier-keyed method record instead of a union of `[identifier, method]` tuples.
  - `HttpApiClient.makeWith` removes the default `HttpClientError.HttpClientError` from custom client error types in the returned `Client`, while preserving any additional custom client errors.

  ### Endpoint Helper Types
  - `HttpApiEndpoint.HttpApiEndpoint` now stores lightweight phantom metadata for middleware and request shapes: `~Middleware`, `~MiddlewareServices`, `~Request`, and `~RequestRaw`. Its type identifier field is now `readonly [TypeId]: typeof TypeId`.
  - `HttpApiEndpoint.Constraint` is now a lightweight structural endpoint constraint and does not extend `Pipeable`; values typed only as `HttpApiEndpoint.Constraint` do not expose `.pipe`.
  - `HttpApiEndpoint.AddError` has been removed; it was not used internally by the `HttpApi` implementation.
  - `HttpApiEndpoint.Json` and `HttpApiEndpoint.StringTree` have been removed in
    favor of the canonical `Schema.toCodecJson` and `Schema.toCodecStringTree`
    types.
  - Omitted request-part metadata now remains `never` instead of being wrapped as
    `Schema.toCodecStringTree<never>`; codec metadata is applied only when
    a params, query, payload, or headers schema is present.
  - Success metadata now applies `Schema.toCodecJson` only to buffered
    success schemas and preserves stream success schemas unchanged, including
    mixed buffered and streaming success arrays.
  - Handler request parts are now flattened with `Struct.Simplify`, improving
    displayed request types while reducing handler instantiations.
  - Endpoint helper types now read metadata fields directly instead of re-inferring all type parameters from the full `HttpApiEndpoint` interface. This affects helpers such as `Identifier`, `Success`, `Error`, `Params`, `Query`, `Payload`, `Headers`, `Middleware`, `MiddlewareServices`, `Errors`, `ErrorServicesEncode`, `ErrorServicesDecode`, `Request`, `RequestRaw`, `ServerServices`, and `ClientServices`.
  - `HttpApiClient.Client.Method` and related generated-client helpers now require endpoint types that satisfy `HttpApiEndpoint.ConstraintRequest`. Endpoint-like structural types must include the lightweight request metadata fields to be accepted.

### Patch Changes

- [#2475](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2475) [`b7d46ab`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/b7d46ab7e1a29d8711817bab583c9febf48a0dad) Thanks @tim-smart! - Update `Schema.Void` to model ignored `void` return values.

  Runtime parsing now accepts any present value and discards it as `undefined`.
  This matches TypeScript `void` return values, where callers do not observe the
  returned value. Use `Schema.Undefined` when the input must be exactly
  `undefined`.

- [#2479](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2479) [`7777e15`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/7777e1540fd3680dd8346723cffec812b9384669) Thanks @tim-smart! - Add custom error callbacks to Effect.fromOption.

This aligns these schema wrappers with other wrappers that retain their source schema for type-level and runtime introspection.

This avoids relying on thrown exceptions for routine validation while preserving the same invalid URL issue and successful decode output.

### Patch Changes

- [#2462](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2462) [`0b5795a`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/0b5795a0ab4395e8f15955d8d96f2303084bfc64) Thanks @tim-smart! - Add `Statement.valuesUnprepared` for returning unprepared SQL statement rows as arrays.

- [#2455](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2455) [`3e3a859`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/3e3a859ec6351a9e0d31674aabbd48fcefabb12e) Thanks @fubhy! - Fix `Cron.next` skipping earlier matching days when the upcoming day-of-month does not exist in the current month.

  Checks added after `flip` are now preserved as `encodingChecks` across
  `Declaration`, `Arrays`, `Objects`, and `Union`, even when rebuilding the AST
  does not change child nodes. `toType` now projects those checks consistently,
  and parsing applies encoded-side checks to the local encoded value when an
  encoding chain is present without allowing encoded-side `parseOptions`
  annotations to affect the current parser side.

- [#2446](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2446) [`85b6317`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/85b631701e935866f2762bd595237aa718370cd9) Thanks @IMax153! - Allow schemas provided to CLI flags / arguments to utilize the environment required by the CLI

- [#2442](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2442) [`7e1f455`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/7e1f455fab5005d769b939c91e519d450f802cf9) Thanks @gcanti! - Improve Schema type-level performance by lazily computing schema views,
  specializing common struct projections, and using lighter schema constraints at
  API boundaries that do not need the full schema protocol.

  This also adds the Schema type-performance benchmark suite, introduces
  `Schema.toCodecArrayFromSingle`, preserves canonical StringTree array codecs,
  renames the arbitrary-generation annotation constraint for clarity, and updates
  affected codec, parser, channel, SQL, HTTP API, persistence, RPC, AI, OpenAPI,
  and workflow typings to match the refined Schema surface.

- [#2464](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2464) [`46b3e79`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/46b3e79944cfdae7901eb148135c85b7eb39834e) Thanks @tim-smart! - do not use performance.timeOrigin and calculate origins lazily

- [#2444](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2444) [`c1dfd60`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/c1dfd60663eb13a58916f3712d877499943b628a) Thanks @bweis! - Avoid throwing when `Error.stackTraceLimit` is non-writable (frozen intrinsics / SES / deterministic sandboxes such as Temporal).

  Effect manipulates `Error.stackTraceLimit` in several internal spots to capture short or empty stack traces cheaply. In hardened environments where `Error` is frozen and `stackTraceLimit` is read-only, assigning to it throws, which broke Effect entirely. Stack-trace-limit manipulation is now best-effort and silently no-ops when the property cannot be modified, mirroring Node's own internal guard. Behavior in normal (writable) environments is unchanged.

  Replace regex-based TemplateLiteral parsing with backtracking segmentation over
  template literal parts, applying part checks during matching.

  Use schema membership when selecting Record index signature keys, including
  checked string, number, symbol, and TemplateLiteral parameters. Tighten valid
  index signature parameters on both type and encoded sides, and preserve key
  parameter semantics in codec transformations.

- [#2407](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2407) [`867c0d7`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/867c0d70a09079b040260d45a1e92ff04dbfbf2f) Thanks @gcanti! - Normalize error behavior for Schema and SchemaParser boundary APIs.

  `SchemaError` now extends `Data.TaggedError`, so it is also a native `Error`.
  SchemaParser Promise APIs now reject an `Error` whose cause is the
  `SchemaIssue.Issue` for schema failures.

  Schema and SchemaParser `Effect` and `Exit` adapters now preserve full causes
  while mapping schema issue failures to their public error type. The `is`,
  `asserts`, `Promise`, `Sync`, `Result`, `Option`, `make`, and `makeOption`
  adapters now distinguish schema issues from non-schema causes. Schema-only
  failures are converted to the adapter's normal representation (`false`,
  rejected or thrown schema error, `Result.fail`, or `None`), while non-schema
  causes throw or reject with an `Error` whose cause is the underlying `Cause`.

- [#2409](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2409) [`b93bc6c`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/b93bc6c9cb27b909a41d094c97c4f9d25bbc6d6b) Thanks @tim-smart! - Fix Stream.runForEachWhile so it continues across chunk boundaries while the predicate returns true and stops when the predicate returns false.

- [#2424](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2424) [`57d387f`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/57d387f92c30ab63e15e3e641f0a903b65886610) Thanks @tim-smart! - Fix cluster workflow activity defect hydration

  `ConfigProvider.orElse` now keeps each side's own `nested` and `mapInput`
  behavior. Applying `nested` or `mapInput` to a combined provider now applies the
  same transformation to both sides.

  `ConfigProvider` path transformations now compose as a single path function.
  This makes `nested` and `mapInput` behave consistently with normal function
  composition.

  `Config.nested` now tracks the logical config path in `Config` itself instead of
  wrapping the provider. This keeps lookup paths and schema error paths aligned.
  The low-level `Config.make` constructor is no longer exported; use config
  constructors and combinators, or implement custom lookup behavior with
  `ConfigProvider.make`.

  `ConfigProvider.fromDir` now returns `undefined` when neither a file nor a
  directory exists at the requested path, so `orElse` can fall back instead of
  failing with `SourceError`.

- [#2415](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2415) [`9cf3a25`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/9cf3a25c66b0c44a52be9829870c44517ea52db2) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix `Effect.try` thunk usage and `Effect.tryPromise` mapper and signal handling defects.

  `Effect.try` now supports passing a thunk directly, matching `Effect.tryPromise`. Thrown values from direct-thunk usage are mapped to `Cause.UnknownError`.

  When a promise handled by `Effect.tryPromise` rejected and the custom `catch` mapper threw while mapping that rejection, the effect could remain pending and produce an unhandled rejection. The mapper is now guarded consistently with the synchronous throw path, so a thrown mapper error becomes an Effect defect. The JSDoc for `Effect.try` and `Effect.tryPromise` was also corrected.

  `Effect.tryPromise` now also only creates an `AbortController` when the wrapped thunk declares an `AbortSignal` parameter.

  schemas. Invalid present values now propagate validation errors instead of
  using the default, closes [#2384](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/issues/2384).

  Previously, the type predicate always extracted union members by `_tag`, even
  when `toTaggedUnion` was created with a different discriminant key. Runtime
  behavior already used the supplied key, so this aligns the type-level narrowing
  with the existing runtime behavior.

  The prompt races user input against events from the dequeue, allowing background events to trigger re-renders without waiting for a keypress:

  ```ts
  const eventQueue = yield * Queue.make<number>();

  const prompt = Prompt.custom(
    { count: 0 },
    Queue.asDequeue(eventQueue), // <-- provide the event queue as a dequeue to the prompt
    {

  Bare top-level statements cannot be `#__PURE__`-annotated by the build, so
  bundlers must retain them and everything they reference, even in bundles that
  never use the code:
  - `Option`: the standalone `Object.defineProperty(SomeProto, "valueOrUndefined", ...)`
    statement anchored the whole `Option` proto chain into every bundle. It is
    now folded into the `SomeProto` initializer.
  - `Headers`: same pattern with `Object.defineProperties(Proto, ...)`, folded
    into the initializer.
  - `Logger`: module-level `process.stdout.isTTY` property reads (potential
    getters, never droppable) moved inside `consolePretty`.
  - `Utils`: when `internalCall` was unused, its dropped binding left behind a
    retained initializer tail (`standard`/`forced` probe with computed property
    reads). The selection is now wrapped in a single pure-annotated call.

  A minimal `Effect.succeed(123).pipe(Effect.runFork)` bundle shrinks by ~1.3%
  gzipped; bundles that don't use `Option` or `Headers` no longer pay for them.

  Range checks such as `isGreaterThan`, `isLessThan`, and `isBetween` now populate `ctx.constraints.ordered`
  instead of type-specific range fields on `number`, `date`, or `bigint` constraints. Custom `toArbitrary`
  annotations that read range constraints should migrate to `ctx.constraints.ordered`.

  This also fixes BigDecimal arbitrary generation by adapting decimal bounds to the generated scale, avoiding
  invalid fast-check bigint ranges for narrow decimal intervals.

  Migration from the previous v4 API:
  - Replace filter annotations from `toArbitraryConstraint: constraint` to `arbitrary: { constraint }`. When a filter cannot be described as a constraint, use `arbitrary: { candidate }` to add a weighted source that is still checked by the filter.
  - Replace bucketed constraints with the flat `Schema.Annotations.ToArbitrary.Constraint` shape:
    - `string.minLength`, `array.minLength`, object property counts, collection sizes -> `minLength`
    - `string.maxLength`, `array.maxLength`, object property counts, collection sizes -> `maxLength`
    - `string.patterns` -> `patterns`
    - `number.isInteger` -> `integer`
    - `number.noNaN` -> `noNaN`
    - `number.noDefaultInfinity` -> `noInfinity`
    - `date.noInvalidDate` -> `valid`
    - `array.comparator` for uniqueness -> `unique` using Effect equality
    - `ordered.min` / `minExcluded` / `max` / `maxExcluded` -> `ordered.minimum` / `exclusiveMinimum` / `maximum` / `exclusiveMaximum`
  - In arbitrary hooks, read `context.constraint` instead of `context.constraints`. Replace `context.isSuspend` with `context.recursion`; when combining finite and recursive branches, pass `context.recursion` to `fc.oneof` with the finite branch first.
  - Generic declaration hooks now receive type parameters as `{ arbitrary, terminal }`. Atomic declarations may still return a bare `FastCheck.Arbitrary<T>`, but generic declarations should return `{ arbitrary, terminal }` when they can preserve a finite terminal branch.
  - `Schema.toArbitrary(schema, { report: true })` now returns `{ value, report }`; without `{ report: true }`, it keeps returning the arbitrary directly. `Schema.toArbitraryLazy` always returns a lazy arbitrary.

  functions, `Schema.Error()` and `Schema.Defect()`.

  Unify `Schema.ErrorWithStack` into `Schema.Error({ includeStack: true })` and
  `Schema.DefectWithStack` into `Schema.Defect({ includeStack: true })`.

  Error causes are encoded by default using the same JSON defect encoding
  semantics used by `Schema.Defect`; pass `{ excludeCause: true }` to omit nested
  cause data.

  Equivalent `Schema.Error` and `Schema.Defect` options are canonicalized, so
  repeated constructor calls with the same option values reuse the same schema.

  `Schema.Defect()` now models defects as `unknown` values with a JSON encoded
  form. Error-shaped JSON objects with a string `message` decode to JavaScript
  `Error` values, so non-`Error` objects such as `{ message: "boom" }` do not
  round-trip unchanged. Other non-`Error` values are normalized through JSON
  serialization, with non-JSON values falling back to Effect's formatted string
  representation.

- [#2181](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2181) [`4be4c8d`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/4be4c8d60862aa963869ee2ed9ffa048ffac0527) Thanks @zeyuri! - Fix workflow proxy RPC handlers to provide the context expected by RpcServer.

- [#2177](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2177) [`0c9d3ab`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/0c9d3ab43eb721a370ed8306260cbac218c27e87) Thanks @mikearnaldi! - Add forked memo maps so nested layer scopes can reuse parent allocations without leaking sibling-local layers. Update `@effect/vitest` to fork memo maps for nested `it.layer` suites, isolating sibling setup while preserving parent sharing.

- [#2206](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2206) [`b156acc`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/b156accd2691b4a051f823affdece7c39923ce85) Thanks @tim-smart! - add `availableShardGroups` to ShardingConfig, to ensure advisory locks do not conflict

- [#2184](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2184) [`d16c034`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/d16c03434ee3e6dcd3bfc82b65d99e881d89025b) Thanks @gcanti! - Restore support for passing schema parse options when creating decode and encode helpers, closes [#2174](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/issues/2174).

- [#2176](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2176) [`b559d68`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/b559d68845f848a10153395778f035682d399075) Thanks @patroza! - Allow Schema decoding defaults to require Effect services.

  The `Effect` passed to `Schema.withDecodingDefault`, `Schema.withDecodingDefaultKey`, `Schema.withDecodingDefaultType`, and `Schema.withDecodingDefaultTypeKey` now accepts a context `R` in its third type parameter. The required services are propagated into the resulting schema's `DecodingServices`. `SchemaGetter.withDefault` is widened in the same way.

- [#2113](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/2113) [`a3de5d9`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/a3de5d9215e5cc4a62e2666efbd7c1bf595eb84f) Thanks @patroza! - Allow Schema constructor and decoding defaults to fail with `SchemaError`.

  The `Effect` passed to `Schema.withConstructorDefault`, `Schema.withDecodingDefault`, `Schema.withDecodingDefaultKey`, `Schema.withDecodingDefaultType`, and `Schema.withDecodingDefaultTypeKey` now accepts `SchemaError` in its error channel. When a default fails, the parser unwraps the underlying `SchemaIssue.Issue` and propagates it as a parse failure with the surrounding path attached. This makes it easy to use another schema's `makeEffect` / `decode*` as the default value.

Supported unique constraint violations now classify as `UniqueViolation` instead of the broader `ConstraintError` reason.

  This covers PostgreSQL, PGlite, MySQL, MSSQL, and the shared SQLite classification used by the SQLite-family clients. `UniqueViolation.constraint` contains the best available constraint, index, or key identifier and falls back to exactly `"unknown"` when no reliable identifier is available.

On Cloudflare Workers with `allow_eval_during_startup` (default for `compatibility_date >= 2025-06-01`), pass `{ useRecords: false }` to prevent msgpackr's JIT code generation via `new Function()`, which is blocked during request handling. Also fixes silent error swallowing in the `msgPack` decode path — non-incomplete errors are now rethrown instead of returning `[]`.

  The return type of a `Schema.makeFilter` predicate now supports two additional shapes:
  - `{ path, issue }` where `issue` is `string | SchemaIssue.Issue` (previously only `{ path, message: string }` was accepted). The `issue` arm lets you attach a fully-formed `Issue` at a nested path without manually constructing a `Pointer`.
  - `ReadonlyArray<Schema.FilterIssue>` to report several failures at once. An empty array is success, a single-element array is equivalent to returning that element, and multi-entry arrays are grouped into an `Issue.Composite`. This removes the need to import `SchemaIssue` and hand-build a `Composite` for multi-field validators.

  The single-failure shapes (`undefined`, `true`, `false`, `string`, `SchemaIssue.Issue`) are unchanged.

  **Breaking**: the object shape renamed from `{ path, message }` to `{ path, issue }`. Call sites that used the old shape must rename the field; the migration is mechanical.

  ```ts
  // before
  Schema.makeFilter((o) => ({ path: ["a"], message: "bad" }));

  // after
  Schema.makeFilter((o) => ({ path: ["a"], issue: "bad" }));
  ```

  Also renamed `{ path, message }` to `{ path, issue }` in the accepted return type of `SchemaGetter.checkEffect`.

  The previous implementation marked every visited object in a single `seen` set and never removed it, so any value that referenced the same object through two different paths (a DAG, e.g. `{ x: shared, y: shared }`) was treated as a cycle and returned `false`. Cycle detection now tracks only the current recursion path (popping on exit) and memoizes fully validated subtrees, so DAGs are accepted while true cycles are still rejected.

  The parameter only carried `additionalProperties`, but the function caches results in a `WeakMap` keyed solely on the `api` instance. Passing different options across calls for the same api was silently ignored, making the parameter order-dependent and effectively single-shot. No call sites were using it, so the signature is now simply `fromApi(api)`.

  The stream consumer was `forkScoped`, causing it to be interrupted before
  it could drain remaining queue items. Replaced with `forkChild` and

  Previously, when converting a web `Response` to an `HttpServerResponse` via `fromWeb`, the `Content-Type` header was not passed to `Body.stream()`, causing it to default to `application/octet-stream`. This affected any code using `HttpApp.fromWebHandler` to wrap web handlers, as JSON responses would incorrectly have their Content-Type set to `application/octet-stream` instead of `application/json`.

- [#1613](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1613) [`2ed26b1`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/2ed26b139805700e3df39efaa768ff01565e5c86) Thanks @lucas-barake! - Add `disableFatalDefects` to `RpcServer.layerHttp`, `RpcServer.toHttpEffect`, and `RpcServer.toHttpEffectWebsocket` option types to match existing runtime support.

- [#1599](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1599) [`e832a57`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/e832a57b570fe38f010c1fd99bceac5a325a9e07) Thanks @tim-smart! - add trait for customizing exit codes

- [#1611](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1611) [`7f01be7`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/7f01be7f8db363d4b2e88e6b5571e96bb815786f) Thanks @WebWalks! - Fixed the Error Type on AtomHttpApiClient (Server errors were being incorrectly reported, and we could not determine \_tag to handle)

- [#1612](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1612) [`e965143`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/e9651431e114479e6becf8ca7b1ed99ac7e91ccc) Thanks @tim-smart! - Expose the optional `orElse` fallback parameter in `Effect.catchTags`.

  `Never` index signatures (including `additionalProperties`) instead of `{ not: {} }`.
  Annotated `Never` still emits a schema object so metadata like `description` is preserved.

  - Reorder `Command` type parameters to `Command<Name, Input, ContextInput, E, R>` for clearer parent-context modeling.
  - Make `Command.withSubcommands` input typing sound for downstream input-based combinators by reflecting that subcommand paths only carry parent context input.

- [#1604](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1604) [`1e70b72`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/1e70b72d0b210474d0e96a15a5cfc279eae37e0c) Thanks @lucas-barake! - Fix `unstable/sql/SqlSchema` request input typing so `findAll` and `findNonEmpty` accept `Request["Type"]` instead of `Request["Encoded"]`.

- [#1496](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1496) [`595d2d6`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/595d2d6e7d50419f3532bd39266191532ace38f2) Thanks @IMax153! - Refactor unstable CLI global flags to command-scoped declarations.

  ### Breaking changes
  - Remove `GlobalFlag.add`, `GlobalFlag.remove`, and `GlobalFlag.clear`
  - Add `Command.withGlobalFlags(...)` as the declaration API for command/subcommand scope
  - Change `GlobalFlag.setting` constructor to curried form which carries type-level identifier:
    - before: `GlobalFlag.setting({ flag, ... })`
    - after: `GlobalFlag.setting("id")({ flag })`
  - Change setting context identity to a stable type-level string:
    - `effect/unstable/cli/GlobalFlag/${id}`

  ### Behavior changes
  - Global flags are now scoped by command path (root-to-leaf declarations)
  - Out-of-scope global flags are rejected for the selected subcommand path
  - Help now renders only global flags active for the requested command path
  - Setting defaults are sourced from `Flag` combinators (`optional`, `withDefault`) rather than setting constructor defaults

- [#1471](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1471) [`c414700`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/c414700ef1932e4b67d0102856de417336912350) Thanks @IMax153! - Make CLI global settings directly yieldable and simplify built-in names.

  `GlobalFlag.setting` now takes `{ flag, defaultValue }` and returns a setting that is a `Context.Reference`, so handlers and `Command.provide*` effects can `yield*` global setting values directly.

  Built-in settings keep internal behavior in `runWith` (for example, `--log-level` still configures `References.MinimumLogLevel`) while also being readable as values.

  Also renamed built-in globals:
  - `GlobalFlag.CompletionsFlag` -> `GlobalFlag.Completions`
  - `GlobalFlag.LogLevelFlag` -> `GlobalFlag.LogLevel`

- [#1490](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1490) [`a30c969`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/a30c9699c0d736cf3952041e45d508b7d58907a9) Thanks @gcanti! - Fix `OpenApi.fromApi` preserving multiple response content types for one status code, closes #1485.

- [#1457](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1457) [`668b703`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/668b70337e9ddbb0d1ae2282a95c282ce404e562) Thanks @tim-smart! - Run request resolver batch fibers with request services by using `Effect.runForkWith`, so resolver delay effects and `runAll` execution see the request service map.

- [#1461](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1461) [`d40e76b`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/d40e76b973543979e60e04a6baca04a8c65bdfc2) Thanks @mikearnaldi! - Fix `Schedule.fixed` double-executing the effect due to clock jitter.

  The `elapsedSincePrevious > window` check included sleep time from the
  previous step, so any timer imprecision (e.g. 1001ms for a 1000ms sleep)
  triggered an immediate zero-delay re-execution.

- [#1464](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1464) [`6e18cf8`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/6e18cf883e9905ca718a6697b6a2a4bbd42739aa) Thanks @gcanti! - Use the `identifier` annotation as the expected message when available, closes #1458.

- [#1475](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1475) [`86062e8`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/86062e8a0c61bca5412fc40d2cf151d676901f08) Thanks @tim-smart! - Add a CI check job that runs `pnpm ai-docgen` and fails if it produces uncommitted changes.

- [#1448](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1448) [`c27ce75`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/c27ce75d34c74dcfc6dba1bf77f1ce88f410a0de) Thanks @IMax153! - Refactor CLI built-in options to use Effect services with `GlobalFlag`

  Built-in CLI flags (`--help`, `--version`, `--completions`, `--log-level`) are now implemented as Effect services using `Context.Reference`. This provides:
  - **Visibility**: Built-in flags now appear in help output's "GLOBAL FLAGS" section
  - **Extensibility**: Users can register custom global flags via `GlobalFlag.add`
  - **Override capability**: Built-in flag behavior can be replaced or disabled
  - **Composability**: Flags compose via Effect's service system

  New `GlobalFlag` module exports:
  - `Action<A>` and `Setting<A>` types for different flag behaviors
  - `Help`, `Version`, `Completions`, `LogLevel` references for built-in flags
  - `add`, `remove`, `clear` functions for managing global flags

  Example:

  ```typescript
  const app = Command.make("myapp");
  Command.run(app, { version: "1.0.0" }).pipe(
    GlobalFlag.add(CustomFlag, customFlagValue),
  );
  ```

- [#1470](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1470) [`484caec`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/484caec47cccac8b86db2910742e406dfc7173ab) Thanks @tim-smart! - Add `Command.withAlias` for unstable CLI commands, including subcommand parsing by alias and help output that renders aliases as `name, alias` in subcommand listings.

  Previously, `stripResolvedApprovals` only ran when there were pending approvals
  in the current round. Stale artifacts from earlier rounds would leak to the
  provider, causing errors. The stripping now runs unconditionally.

  In streaming mode, pre-resolved tool results are also emitted as stream parts
  so `Chat.streamText` persists them to history, preventing re-resolution on
  subsequent rounds.

### Patch Changes

- [#1317](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1317) [`f6e133e`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/f6e133e9a16b32317bd09ff08c12b97a0ae44600) Thanks @tim-smart! - support tag unions in Effect.catchTag/Reason

- [#1314](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1314) [`e3893cc`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/e3893ccf2632338c7d8e745f639dcd825a9d42f8) Thanks @zeyuri! - Fix `Atom.serializable` encode/decode for wire transfer.

  Use `Schema.toCodecJson` instead of `Schema.encodeSync`/`Schema.decodeSync` directly, so that encoded values are plain JSON objects that survive serialization roundtrips (JSON, seroval, etc.). Previously, `AsyncResult.Schema` encode produced instances with custom prototypes that were lost after wire transfer, causing decode to fail with "Expected AsyncResult" errors during SSR hydration.

- [#1315](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/pull/1315) [`a88e206`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect-smol/commit/a88e206e44dc66ca5a2b45bedc797877c5dbb083) Thanks @tim-smart! - add Filter.reason api

  Add `Hydration` module to `effect/unstable/reactivity` with `dehydrate`, `hydrate`, and `toValues` for SSR state serialization. Add `HydrationBoundary` React component to `@effect/atom-react` with two-phase hydration (new atoms in render, existing atoms after commit).
