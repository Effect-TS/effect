# `@effect/sql-kysely`

An `@effect/sql` implementation for [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/).

## Disclaimer

This integration is not fully `Future Proof` as it's dependant on some `Kysely` internals.
Meaning that if `Kysely` changes some of its internals (new Builders, Builders renaming, Builders removing, Builders splitting, etc), this integration might break.
So use it at your own risk or pin your `Kysely` version to be sure to not have any breaking changes.
