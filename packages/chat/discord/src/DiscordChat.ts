/**
 * The Discord adapter for `effect/chat`: the `Registry` layer, the

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Gateway intents: `GUILDS`, `GUILD_MESSAGES`, `GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS`,
 *   `DIRECT_MESSAGES`, `DIRECT_MESSAGE_REACTIONS` and `MESSAGE_CONTENT`.
 *   They are set in the consumer's dfx config.
 * - `MESSAGE_CONTENT` is a privileged intent: switch it on for the

 *   on every message that doesn't mention the bot, and attachments are
 *   missing.
 * - Bot permissions: View Channel, Send Messages, Send Messages in Threads,

/**
 * The Discord side of the adapter, for what the core has no op for.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `botUserId` comes from `GET /users/@me`, read once. A failed read is
 *   tried again next time.
 * - `dispatch` takes one gateway dispatch, `{ t, d }`, and hands its
 *   events to the `ChatHandler` one at a time. It reads `d` with a Schema
 *   and ignores what it doesn't know, so it takes no dfx type.
 * - When a `MESSAGE_CREATE` carries no `channel_type`, `dispatch` looks
 *   the channel up, cached and with a five second timeout. A failed lookup
 *   is logged and fails with `NotAccepted`. A lookup that would fail the same
 *   way again, such as a deleted channel, is logged and the event dropped.
 * - `interaction` takes one `INTERACTION_CREATE` payload, from the gateway
 *   or from an HTTP interactions endpoint. It reads it with a Schema, so it
 *   takes no dfx type, and ignores an interaction that is not from an
 *   element this adapter built, a slash command for one. It calls the
 *   handler through `ChatInteraction.handle` and answers through the
 *   interaction callback endpoint, which has to land inside Discord's 3
 *   seconds: `deadline` is the handler's share, 2 seconds by default.
 * - A click is answered with callback type 6, or type 9 for `OpenModal`.
 *   A submit's `close` is type 6. An `errors` reply is type 4 with the
 *   ephemeral flag, listing each message as plain text, and the modal closes: Discord
 *   can't show an error inside a modal, so the descriptor has no
 *   `modalErrors`.
 * - A modal that can't be built, or whose callback fails, goes to
 *   `Handler.refused`. A callback that comes back 404 `Unknown interaction`
 *   was late: for a modal that is `NotFound` with detail
 *   `interaction_expired`. A failed ack is logged.
 * - `guild` reads the channel, cached. `None` for a direct.

/**
 * Registers the Discord adapter in the `Registry`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Every REST call goes through the `DiscordREST` in context. dfx waits on
 *   its rate-limit buckets and sends again after a 429, so a rate limit
 *   shows up as a slower call. `HttpClient` is used only to download
 *   attachments from Discord's CDN, with no token.
 * - Content goes out as written: Discord reads Markdown itself. Every write
 *   sends `allowed_mentions: { parse: [] }` and the `SUPPRESS_EMBEDS`
 *   flag, on the post and on every edit, unless `withPostOptions` says
 *   otherwise. A reply does not ping its author.
 * - `post` and `edit` fail with `TooLarge` before calling Discord past
 *   2,000 code points.
 * - A refused file fails `denied` with detail `file_refused` and leaves
 *   nothing posted: more than 10 files or 10 MiB, by the adapter's own
 *   check, or any `denied` answer to a post with files. The reason Discord
 *   gave is the `cause`.
 * - A message's elements go out as classic components beside `content`,
 *   in action rows: five buttons to a row and a select alone in its row, in
 *   the order given, up to five rows. More fail `TooLarge` before the call.
 *   An `edit` without `actions` removes the ones there were.
 * - A button's id and encoded value share one `custom_id`, joined by one
 *   character, and so do a modal's id and its metadata. An id may not
 *   contain U+241F, the join. `limits.actionDataLength` and
 *   `limits.modalMetadataLength` are 99 code points, the 100 of
 *   `custom_id` less the join.
 * - Button styles: `default` is secondary, `primary` primary and
 *   `danger` danger.
 * - A modal's inputs are Label components around a text input or a string
 *   select, and a `text` is a text display. Inputs and texts together are
 *   5 at most. A modal over that, or with a title or label over 45
 *   characters, reaches `Handler.refused` as `TooLarge`. Discord has no
 *   submit label, so `submitLabel` is not shown.
 * - `replyTo` sends a message reference. Discord refuses a reply to a
 *   message that is gone, unless `withPostOptions({ failIfNotExists: false })`
 *   lets it through as a plain message.
 * - Only `DEFAULT`, `REPLY`, `CHAT_INPUT_COMMAND` and
 *   `CONTEXT_MENU_COMMAND` messages are messages. A forward, a poll, a
 *   sticker or a components-only message is `DEFAULT` and comes through,
 *   often with `text: ""`. Its content stays on `raw`.
 * - A deferred command reply arrives empty. Its text comes in a later edit,
 *   which is not delivered, so only `history` and `fetchMessage` have it.
 * - A webhook message has the webhook id as its author id and `isBot`.
 *   `getUser` on that id fails `NotFound`.
 * - A mention is reported when its token is in `content` outside code and
 *   Discord says it resolved. A reply that pings its author is not a
 *   mention. Only the bot's user mention is `isSelf`: a mention of its
 *   managed role is the consumer's to recognise.
 * - The address of a thread is its channel id. `startThread` names the
 *   thread after the message's text, cut to 100 characters, and gives the
 *   existing thread when the message already has one.
 * - `history` of a thread started from a message puts the opener, from the
 *   parent channel, in place of Discord's placeholder. When the opener is
 *   deleted it starts at the first reply. A forum post's starter is in the
 *   thread itself.
 * - `getUser` with `in` gives the guild nick.
 * - There is no native streaming: streamed replies post, then edit, at
 *   least 1.5 seconds apart.

/**
 * For a host that is stopped and started again, a Durable Object for one:
 * feeds every dispatch to `DiscordChat.dispatch` from dfx's `DispatchHook`,
 * before the shard stores the dispatch's sequence.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when an event must not be lost to a restart, in place of
 * `layerGateway`. Never provide both: every event would be delivered twice.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Provide it to the dfx layer that builds the shards, `DiscordGatewayLive`
 *   or `ShardLive`, beside a `ShardStateStore` over storage that outlives
 *   the host. dfx keeps the session id, the resume URL and the sequence
 *   there, so a host built again sends RESUME, not IDENTIFY, and Discord
 *   sends what it missed.
 * - The handler runs before the sequence is stored. A host stopped in the
 *   middle of an event never stored that event's sequence, so the RESUME
 *   brings the event back.
 * - An event that fails with `NotAccepted` fails the hook. dfx drops the
 *   connection, resumes from the last stored sequence and gets the event
 *   again, after 1 second, doubling with every failure in a row up to 2
 *   minutes. An event that is refused every time holds back every event
 *   after it.
 * - A defect in the handler is logged and the event dropped, as a replay
 *   would only fail the same way.
 * - Delivery is at least once. A host stopped after the handler returned and
 *   before the sequence was stored gets that event a second time, so a
 *   handler that can't take an event twice remembers the ids it took.
 * - The hook runs on the shard's read loop, one dispatch at a time. A
 *   handler slower than Discord's heartbeat interval, about 41 seconds,
 *   makes the shard reconnect.
 * - Interactions stay with `layerGatewayInteractions`: each has 3 seconds,
 *   so there is nothing to resume.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Discord replays only while it keeps the session. When it refuses the
 *   RESUME, dfx identifies again and the events in between are gone.
 * - Waking the host, restarting a shard that went quiet and backing off
 *   after a close Discord won't change its mind on, an invalid token (4004)
 *   or a disallowed intent (4014), stay with the host: dfx reconnects
 *   whatever the close code.
 *
 * **Example** (Resuming from the host's own storage)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { DiscordChat } from "@effect/chat-discord"
 * import { ShardLive } from "dfx/DiscordGateway/Shard"
 * import { type ShardState, ShardStateStore } from "dfx/DiscordGateway/Shard/StateStore"
 * import { Effect, Layer, Option } from "effect"
 *
 * // Stands in for storage that outlives the host.
 * const storage = new Map<string, ShardState>()
 *
 * const SessionStore = Layer.succeed(
 *   ShardStateStore,
 *   ShardStateStore.of({
 *     forShard: ([id, count]) => {
 *       const key = `${id}/${count}`
 *       return {
 *         get: Effect.sync(() => Option.fromUndefinedOr(storage.get(key))),

 *         clear: Effect.sync(() => void storage.delete(key))
