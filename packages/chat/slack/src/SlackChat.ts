/**
 * The Slack adapter for `effect/chat`: the `Registry` layer, the Events API
 * webhook, the Interactivity route for buttons and modals, the pure
 * normalisers, address helpers and the scoped post options.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Bot token scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:history`, `groups:history`,
 *   `im:history`, `mpim:history`, `channels:read`, `groups:read`,
 *   `im:read`, `mpim:read`, `users:read`, `reactions:read`, `files:read`
 *   and `files:write`.
 * - Event subscriptions, sent to `layerWebhook`'s path: `message.channels`,
 *   `message.groups`, `message.im`, `message.mpim`, `app_mention`,
 *   `reaction_added`, `reaction_removed` and `agent_session_stopped`.
 * - Buttons, selects and modals need Interactivity, which is its own
 *   switch in the app settings, off by default, with its own Request URL,
 *   separate from Event Subscriptions. Point it at `layerInteractivity`'s
 *   path. With Socket Mode on, Slack sends interactions over the socket and
 *   never to the URL: pass each payload to `SlackChat.interaction` and send
 *   its result as the envelope ack's `payload`.
 * - Slash commands need the `commands` scope. Declare each in the app
 *   manifest under `features.slash_commands`, or in the app settings under
 *   Slash Commands, with its Request URL set to `layerInteractivity`'s path.
 *   The name, less its slash, is the id of the `ChatInteraction.command`,
 *   and the manifest's description and usage hint are what Slack shows.
 *   With Socket Mode on, commands come as `slash_commands` envelopes: pass
 *   the envelope's `payload` to `SlackChat.interaction` in the same way.
 * - A command can't be run inside a thread: Slack doesn't offer it there.
 *   A command that acts on a thread has to be told which one. Command names are shared by every app
 *   in a workspace. "Escape channels, users, and links" is off by default;
 *   with it on, `text` carries `<@U…|name>` and `<#C…|name>` tokens.
 * - Slack's stop button also needs the app declared as an agent with
 *   `features.agent_view` in the manifest. Slack documents that declaration
 *   as irreversible. Without it the adapter's session status calls answer
 *   `not_authorized`; it then stops making them, and replies still work.
 * - A click on the stop button stops nothing by itself: the consumer gets a
 *   `StopRequested` and ends the reply. Until it does, the user sees a
 *   disabled button. Every click is a separate `StopRequested`, and only
 *   the first in a thread lists the open stream in `messageIds`.

/**
 * The Slack side of the adapter, for what the core has no op for.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `botUserId` comes from `auth.test`, read once. A failed read is tried
 *   again next time.
 * - `user` calls `users.info` each time. Nothing is cached.
 * - `interaction` is the entry for a decoded Interactivity `payload`
 *   (`block_actions` or `view_submission`), as `DiscordChat.interaction`
 *   is for Discord, and for a slash command: the form fields of its
 *   request, or the `payload` of a `slash_commands` envelope, as one
 *   object. It normalises with `normalizeInteraction`, calls the
 *   handler through `ChatInteraction.handle` inside `deadline` (2.5
 *   seconds by default, the handler's share of Slack's 3), opens a modal
 *   with `views.open` and calls `Handler.refused` when it can't.
 * - A modal's title is held to 24 code points, each input label to 2,000 and
 *   the modal's id to 255. These are not on the descriptor. A modal past one
 *   of them is not opened: `Handler.refused` gets `TooLarge`, and the click
 *   is still acked. A portable modal keeps its title to 24.
 * - Slack needs a submit button on a modal with inputs, so a modal with no
 *   `submitLabel` gets the English "Submit". Pass `submitLabel` to localise
 *   it.
 * - It succeeds with the body to answer Slack with: the JSON of the 200 on
 *   the Request URL, or the `payload` of the envelope ack on Socket Mode.
 *   For a command answered with `respond` that body is the message, with
 *   `response_type` `ephemeral` or `in_channel`, after the checks of a
 *   `post`; one that fails them goes to `Handler.refused`. A command's
 *   answer mentions nobody: `withPostOptions` does not reach it, so
 *   `<@U…>` goes out escaped and shows as text. There is no way to allow a
 *   mention in it.
 *   `undefined` is an empty answer: an ack, a close, a late click, a
 *   deferred command, a command that opened a modal, a command nobody
 *   handles, or a payload that is not from an element this adapter built.
 * - `Late` is a submit or a command whose handler ran past the deadline
 *   and was interrupted. It is not an answer, since an empty one would close
 *   the modal, or tell the user the command worked: `layerInteractivity`
 *   answers 503 for it, and a caller on Socket Mode sends no ack. For a
 *   command, Slack's desktop client then shows its own private failure
 *   notice and keeps the text; its iOS client shows nothing. `Late` is
 *   itself a JSON value, so test for it with `Schema.is(ChatInteraction.Late)`
 *   before treating the result as a body.
 * - `Chat.followUp` on a deferred command posts once to the command's
 *   `response_url`, which must be on a Slack host, through the layer's
 *   `HttpClient`. It is a write and is not retried. Slack takes five posts
 *   to one `response_url` within 30 minutes, each a new message. A spent
 *   or expired one answers 404 `used_url` or `expired_url`, which is
 *   `NotFound` with detail `interaction_expired`.
 * - A click on a private answer has no `message`. Its `messageId` is the
 *   answer's `container.message_ts`, which no Web API method reaches:
 *   `chat.update` on it answers `message_not_found`. `raw` has
 *   `container.is_ephemeral`. A public answer reads back as a
 *   `bot_message` whose `bot_id` is not the app's own, so it is not
 *   `isSelf`.
 * - `interaction` checks no signature and no app id: that is the
 *   transport's job. It needs `ChatInteraction.Handler` where it is
 *   called, so the layer does not need it.

/**
 * Registers the Slack adapter in the `Registry`, for one workspace.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `post` and `edit` send the Markdown as one `markdown` block, in which
 *   a `<` outside inline and fenced code goes as `&lt;`, plus a `text` the
 *   adapter builds, in which every `<`, `>` and `&` goes as an entity.
 *   Slack decides who a message mentions from `text`, so no token notifies
 *   unless `withPostOptions({ notify })` allows it. Allowed tokens stay
 *   intact in both.
 * - That `text` is cut to 16,000 code points on a post and 3,800 UTF-8
 *   bytes on an edit, on a grapheme cluster boundary, ending in `…` with
 *   the allowed tokens the cut left out appended. The cut never fails.
 * - Stream appends go as `markdown_text`, which has no `text` beside it.
 *   A stream decodes the character references for `<`, `@` and `!`, so
 *   the adapter finds token shapes (`<@`, and `<!` followed by a letter)
 *   with those references decoded, in prose and in code alike, and puts a
 *   zero-width space (U+200B) straight after whatever spells the `<`.
 *   Allowed tokens are sent as they are. An append holds back an unclosed
 *   `<`, a trailing character reference that is not finished and a
 *   trailing high surrogate, and reports them as `held`. The start and a
 *   `flush` hold nothing, so a shape that the next write completes gets
 *   its zero-width space at the start of that write.
 * - Once a stream is stopped, by `stop` or by a user, a message whose appends differ from what
 *   `post` would send gets one `chat.update` as blocks plus `text`,
 *   which takes the zero-width spaces out. It is skipped, leaving them, when
 *   the block would pass 12,000 code points, when the edit fails, and when
 *   an append to the message was left unconfirmed, since `ChatMarkdown`
 *   then rewrites the message itself. A skip fails nothing and sets the
 *   span attribute `slack.stream.cleanup`. A cleanup that is interrupted
 *   runs again on the next `stop` for that message.
 * - `post`, `edit` and stream writes fail with `TooLarge` before calling
 *   Slack when the text as sent passes 12,000 code points. Slack's second
 *   limit, 13,200 with every emoji counted as its shortcode, is left to
 *   Slack, whose refusal is also `TooLarge` and posts nothing.
 *   `descriptor.measure` keeps a part under both.
 * - A post with files uploads them with no channel, posts the message, then
 *   attaches them with `chat.update` and `file_ids`. Both calls send the
 *   same blocks and `text`, so the `text` of a post with files is cut to the
 *   update budget of 3,800 bytes. A post with files and no Markdown carries
 *   the file names, joined by ", ", as its text, and keeps them.
 * - A post with files is all-or-nothing. A file Slack refuses at upload,
 *   one past `limits`, or an attach Slack refuses fails the post `denied`
 *   with detail `file_refused`: a refused attach first deletes the message
 *   and then the files, best effort. A timed out attach is retried, for up
 *   to a minute in all, waits after a 429 included; past that it is rolled
 *   back the same way. When the message can't be deleted, the post fails
 *   `Unknown` with detail `attach_failed_message_left` and a
 *   `SlackAttachFailed` as its cause. From the post on, the route can't be
 *   interrupted, and each call has a timeout.
 * - `edit` keeps a message's files, and `delete` removes the message and
 *   not its files: a user may have shared them on. Read the file ids with
 *   `fetchMessage` before deleting to remove them too.
 * - A mention in a post with files can notify for a message that a refused
 *   attach then deletes.
 * - A post with files in a Slack Connect channel is untested.
 * - `replyTo` is not supported.
 * - A message from another app or an incoming webhook (`bot_message`) has
 *   the `bot_id` as its author id. `getUser` on that id fails `NotFound`.
 * - `getUser`'s `raw` is the user from `users.info`, with its `team_id`.
 *   `SlackChat.user` is the same call with the team, guest and Slack
 *   Connect status as typed fields.
 * - The layer provides the `SlackChat` and `SlackWebApi` services as well
 *   as registering the adapter. A consumer that needs more of Slack than
 *   `Chat` has reads either from context beside `Chat`.
 * - A thread root whose subtype is not a message, such as an agent-view
 *   chat's `assistant_app_thread` root, is treated as deleted: `opener`
 *   gives `None` and history starts at the first reply.
 * - Edits to one message are at least 3 seconds apart.
 * - After a 429 on a stream append or an edit, the next write to that
 *   message waits for the retry-after, and later writes to it wait twice
 *   the interval, for the rest of the reply. A stream started with
 *   `continues` keeps the pace of the part it continues.
 * - The native stream needs a thread and a recipient, and rotates before
 *   Slack's ten minute cap. A reply that ends after a click on the stop
 *   button moves the agent session off `processing`.
 * - A message's buttons, link buttons and selects go in one `actions` block
 *   after the `markdown` block, on `post` and on `edit`. A button's id is
 *   its `action_id` and its value its `value`. A message with elements and
 *   no Markdown has no `markdown` block, and its `text` is the button
 *   labels joined by a space. A streamed reply gets its buttons by `edit`
 *   after the stream stops.
 * - Elements are refused before the call past 25 in a message, for an id
 *   longer than 255 or holding U+241F, and for an id plus a value longer
 *   than 2,000, all in code points.
 * - Text and elements share Slack's 13,200 budget, so
 *   `descriptor.measure(markdown, actions)` counts the `actions` block as
 *   Slack stores it, with every non-ASCII unit at 6. A `value` near 2,000
 *   uses up the budget by itself. A `post` whose elements push it past the
 *   cap fails `TooLarge` with `msg_blocks_too_long`, and nothing is posted.
 *   The adapter never falls back to posting the text and adding the elements
 *   by `edit`. A caller can: `chat.update` had no 13,200 cap when tested,
 *   which Slack does not document.
