# @effect/chat-slack

A [Slack](https://slack.com) adapter for `effect/chat`. Includes the Events API webhook, a pure event normaliser for Socket Mode or your own transport, a minimal Web API client, native streaming replies with the agent stop button, and the Slack emoji table.

## Installation

```sh
npm install effect @effect/chat-slack
```

## Known limits

- A post with files has not been tested in a Slack Connect channel.
- A post with files uploads the files, posts the message, then attaches the files to it. If Slack refuses the attach, the adapter deletes the message. A mention in that message can still notify before the delete, for a message that then disappears. With `ChatMarkdown`'s `unattachedNote`, the reply is posted again without the files, so the mention can notify twice.
