/**
 * The `Invariant` typeclass is a higher-order abstraction over types that allow mapping the contents of a type in both directions.
 * It is similar to the `Covariant` typeclass but provides an `imap` opration, which allows transforming a value in both directions.
 * This typeclass is useful when dealing with data types that can be converted to and from some other types.
 * The `imap` operation provides a way to convert such data types to other types that they can interact with while preserving their invariants.
