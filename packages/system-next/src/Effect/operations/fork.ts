/**
 * Returns an effect that forks this effect into its own separate fiber,
 * returning the fiber immediately, without waiting for it to begin executing
 * the effect.
 *
 * You can use the `fork` method whenever you want to execute an effect in a
 * new fiber, concurrently and without "blocking" the fiber executing other
 * effects. Using fibers can be tricky, so instead of using this method
 * directly, consider other higher-level methods, such as `raceWith`,
 * `zipPar`, and so forth.
 *
 * The fiber returned by this method has methods to interrupt the fiber and to
 * wait for it to finish executing the effect. See `Fiber` for more
 * information.
 *
 * Whenever you use this method to launch a new fiber, the new fiber is
 * attached to the parent fiber's scope. This means when the parent fiber
 * terminates, the child fiber will be terminated as well, ensuring that no
 * fibers leak. This behavior is called "auto supervision", and if this
 * behavior is not desired, you may use the `forkDaemon` or `forkIn` methods.
