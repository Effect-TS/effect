# Introduction

Welcome to your guide on testing Effect applications using `vitest` and the `@effect/vitest` package. This tutorial is crafted to assist beginners in setting up their testing environment and creating robust tests efficiently. The integration of `vitest` with the Effect library enhances your testing capabilities, allowing for more expressive and maintainable tests. Letâ€™s get started with setting up your tools and then dive into writing some effective test cases.

# Requirements

First, install [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/guide/) (version `1.6.0` or newer)

```sh
pnpm add -D vitest
```

Next, install the `@effect/vitest` package. This package integrates the Effect framework with Vitest for enhanced testing capabilities.

```sh
pnpm add -D @effect/vitest
```

# Writing tests

The `@effect/vitest` package extends the `it` function from Vitest with an `effect` property. This allows you to write concise and powerful tests. Here's the basic syntax:

```ts
import { it } from "@effect/vitest"

it(name, () => EffectContainingAssertions)
```

## Testing Successful Operations

Let's test a function that divides two numbers but can fail if the divisor is zero.

```ts
import { expect } from "vitest"
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { it } from "@effect/vitest"

function divide(a: number, b: number) {
  if (b === 0) return Effect.fail("Cannot divide by zero")
  return Effect.succeed(a / b)
}

it.effect("test success", () =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const result = yield* divide(4, 2)
    expect(result).toBe(2)
  })
)
```

## Testing successes and failures as `Exit`

To handle both successes and failures during testing, use `Effect.exit` to convert the result into an `Exit` object.

```ts
import { expect } from "vitest"
import { Effect, Exit } from "effect"
import { it } from "@effect/vitest"

function divide(a: number, b: number) {
  if (b === 0) return Effect.fail("Cannot divide by zero")
  return Effect.succeed(a / b)
}

it.effect("test success as Exit", () =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const result = yield* divide(4, 2).pipe(Effect.exit)
    expect(result).toStrictEqual(Exit.succeed(2))
  })
)

it.effect("test failure as Exit", () =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const result = yield* divide(4, 0).pipe(Effect.exit)
    expect(result).toStrictEqual(Exit.fail("Cannot divide by zero"))
  })
)
```

## Skipping Tests

You can skip a test using `it.effect.skip`, which is useful when you want to temporarily disable a test without deleting any code.

```ts
it.effect.skip("test failure as Exit", () =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const result = yield* divide(4, 0).pipe(Effect.exit)
    expect(result).toStrictEqual(Exit.fail("Cannot divide by zero"))
  })
)
```

## Running a Single Test

To run only a specific test and ignore all others, use `it.effect.only`. This is helpful during development to focus on a single test case.

```ts
it.effect.only("test failure as Exit", () =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const result = yield* divide(4, 0).pipe(Effect.exit)
    expect(result).toStrictEqual(Exit.fail("Cannot divide by zero"))
  })
)
```
