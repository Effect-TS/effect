## Building user interfaces with `effect/ui`

`effect/ui` is a frontend framework whose apps are composed with Layers. You
describe a component with Schemas for its props, Model, messages and events,
and with pure `init`, `update` and `view` functions. Side effects are Commands
and Subscriptions that the runtime runs for you, and data comes from `Loader`
reads in `effect/reactivity`. `effect/ui/html` adds the HTML elements, the
browser host and router, and server rendering.

### Organizing an app

The examples below are one notes app. Each example is an entry module, for
the browser, the server or the tests. It mounts a component and provides the
platform Layers, and it defines no components. The app is in
`ai-docs/src/90_ui/fixtures`, laid out as it would be under `src/` in a real
app. Read an example, then the files it imports.

Group files by feature, then by kind within each feature:

```text
fixtures/
  App.ts                      // root component, imports pages
  routes.ts                   // AppRoute
  notes/
    domain/Note.ts            // Schema, errors, NotesTag
    services/Notes.ts         // service and its Layers
    loaders/ListNotes.ts
    loaders/GetNote.ts
    loaders/SearchNotes.ts
    components/NoteEditor.ts  // NoteEditor and its SaveNote command
    components/NoteActivity.ts
    components/ActivityLog.ts
  pages/
    NotesIndex.ts             // /
    notes/NotePage.ts         // /notes/:id
    search/SearchPage.ts      // /search
  server/NotesApi.ts          // the JSON API that Notes calls
```

A second feature is a sibling of `notes/`, with its own `domain`, `services`,
`loaders` and `components` folders. Pages import features, but features never
import pages. Keep `AppRoute` in `routes.ts`, outside `pages/` and separate
from `App.ts`; pages can then build links without importing the root component
that imports them.

Keep one file per route in `pages/`, in folders that mirror the URL. A page's
folder is the static segments of its route's path, and its file is named after
the component. `/` is `pages/NotesIndex.ts`, `/notes/:id` is
`pages/notes/NotePage.ts`, and `/notes/:id/history` would be
`pages/notes/history/NoteHistoryPage.ts`. A param segment gets no folder. The
folder follows the URL, not the feature the page uses.

A command belongs in the file of the component that runs it, not in a shared
`commands/` folder. When two components need the same write, share the service
method and give each component its own command. Loaders have their own folder
because pages, multiple components and server rendering all read them.

A component provides the domain Layers it needs in its own file, with
`Component.provide`: its commands, its loaders and the services they capture.
The plain name, such as `NotePage`, is the component with those Layers
provided, and it is the one parents and entry modules use. The component
without them is exported as `NotePageNoDeps`, for a test that provides its
own. A component that needs no domain Layers has only the plain name.

A memoised Layer is built once per Env, the services a component resolves
from. Provides that resolve from the same Env share it, and so do the provides
below them. It is closed when its last user unmounts. Components under
different provided ancestors each build their own copy, so a service built for
one page never sees another page's dependencies. A service that holds state,
such as a session or a sync engine, is provided by the component that owns its
lifetime, usually the root component. The components below keep naming it in
their own provides and get that instance.

Entry modules sit beside these folders. Each one imports
`effect/ui/html/register` before it renders anything, and provides only
platform Layers such as the Router, the HTTP client and logging. Domain Layers
are never provided there. The server and a test of the whole app swap the HTTP
client, not the services.
