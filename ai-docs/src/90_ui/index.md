## Building user interfaces with `effect/ui`

`effect/ui` is a frontend framework whose apps are composed with Layers. You
describe a component with Schemas for its props, Model, messages and events,
and with pure `init`, `update` and `view` functions. Side effects are Commands
and Subscriptions that the runtime runs for you, and data comes from `Loader`
reads in `effect/reactivity`. `effect/ui/html` adds the HTML elements, the
browser host and router, and server rendering.
