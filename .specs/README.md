# Specifications

This directory contains specifications for all major features and enhancements in the Effect library, following a structured spec-driven development approach that ensures systematic planning, implementation, and validation.

## Structure

Each feature specification follows a standardized structure within its own directory:

- **`instructions.md`** - Initial requirements capture and user story
- **`requirements.md`** - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements  
- **`design.md`** - Technical design and architectural decisions
- **`plan.md`** - Implementation roadmap with progress tracking

## Workflow

The specification-driven development process follows three key phases:

### 1. Specification Phase
Document requirements, design architecture, and create detailed implementation plans before beginning development work.

### 2. Implementation Phase  
Execute the planned implementation following Effect library patterns and quality standards, with continuous validation against specifications.

### 3. Validation Phase
Verify that the final implementation meets all specified requirements and maintains Effect library standards for type safety, functional programming patterns, and comprehensive documentation.

## Features

### Infrastructure & Development Workflow
- [x] **[Spec-Driven Development Integration](./spec-driven-development-integration/)** - Integrated .claude/commands workflow and patterns for systematic feature development

### Core Library Features
(Features will be added here as they are specified and implemented)

### Documentation & Testing  
(Documentation and testing enhancements will be tracked here)

### Platform Integrations
(Platform-specific features and integrations will be documented here)

---

Each feature specification ensures:
- **Systematic Development**: Structured approach from conception to completion
- **Effect Library Compliance**: Adherence to functional programming patterns and type safety standards  
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation including JSDoc compilation, testing, and documentation
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into implementation status and completion criteria
