## Welcome to Effect [![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Effect-TS/core)

Effect is an ecosystem of libraries to write highly productive, purely functional TypeScript at scale.

## Intro Talk

For a quick intro into Effect check out the following talk: [Introduction to Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrNr3JVUc8I&t=2s&ab_channel=WorkerConf)

## Install

We recommend the usage of `yarn` and if you have multiple packages the usage of `yarn workspaces` that sting of dependencies:

```sh
yarn add @effect-ts/core
```

## TSConfig

It's important to make sure 'strict' is enabled.

## Documentation

Coming soon.
