## Summary
- add a regression test demonstrating that child processes spawned via `Command` survive when the parent receives SIGINT
- the test launches a minimal `sigint-wrapper.mjs`, sends SIGINT to the wrapper, and expects the child to be gone; currently it fails because the child remains (PPID=1)
- this PR only introduces the failing test and fixture so the team can reproduce and verify a fix

## Testing
- `pnpm test --filter "Command"` (fails as expected because the issue is still present)
