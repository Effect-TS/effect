## orElse

Returns a fiber that prefers `this` fiber, but falls back to the `that` one
when `this` one fails. Interrupting the returned fiber will interrupt both
fibers, sequentially, from left to right.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const orElse: {
  <E2, A2>(that: Fiber<E2, A2>): <E, A>(self: Fiber<E, A>) => Fiber<E2 | E, A2 | A>
  <E, A, E2, A2>(self: Fiber<E, A>, that: Fiber<E2, A2>): Fiber<E | E2, A | A2>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

# models

## Fiber (interface)

A fiber is a lightweight thread of execution that never consumes more than a
whole thread (but may consume much less, depending on contention and
asynchronicity). Fibers are spawned by forking effects, which run
concurrently with the parent effect.

Fibers can be joined, yielding their result to other fibers, or interrupted,
which terminates the fiber, safely releasing all resources.

**Signature**

```ts
export interface Fiber<E, A> extends Fiber.Variance<E, A>, Pipeable {
  /**
   * The identity of the fiber.
   */
  id(): FiberId

  /**
   * Awaits the fiber, which suspends the awaiting fiber until the result of the
   * fiber has been determined.
   */
  await(): Effect<never, never, Exit<E, A>>

  /**
   * Retrieves the immediate children of the fiber.
   */
  children(): Effect<never, never, Array<Fiber.Runtime<any, any>>>

  /**
   * Inherits values from all `FiberRef` instances into current fiber. This
   * will resume immediately.
   */
  inheritAll(): Effect<never, never, void>

  /**
   * Tentatively observes the fiber, but returns immediately if it is not
   * already done.
   */
  poll(): Effect<never, never, Option<Exit<E, A>>>

  /**
   * In the background, interrupts the fiber as if interrupted from the
   * specified fiber. If the fiber has already exited, the returned effect will
   * resume immediately. Otherwise, the effect will resume when the fiber exits.
   */
  interruptAsFork(fiberId: FiberId.FiberId): Effect<never, never, void>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## RuntimeFiber (interface)

A runtime fiber that is executing an effect. Runtime fibers have an
identity and a trace.

**Signature**

```ts
export interface RuntimeFiber<E, A> extends Fiber<E, A>, Fiber.RuntimeVariance<E, A> {
  /**
   * Reads the current number of ops that have occurred since the last yield
   */
  get currentOpCount(): number

  /**
   * Reads the current value of a fiber ref
   */
  getFiberRef<X>(fiberRef: FiberRef<X>): X

  /**
   * The identity of the fiber.
   */
  id(): FiberId.Runtime

  /**
   * The status of the fiber.
   */
  status(): Effect<never, never, FiberStatus>

  /**
   * Returns the current `RuntimeFlags` the fiber is running with.
   */
  runtimeFlags(): Effect<never, never, RuntimeFlags>

  /**
   * Adds an observer to the list of observers.
   */
  addObserver(observer: (exit: Exit<E, A>) => void): void

  /**
   * Removes the specified observer from the list of observers that will be
   * notified when the fiber exits.
   */
  removeObserver(observer: (exit: Exit<E, A>) => void): void

  /**
   * Retrieves all fiber refs of the fiber.
   */
  getFiberRefs(): FiberRefs

  /**
   * Unsafely observes the fiber, but returns immediately if it is not
   * already done.
   */
  unsafePoll(): Exit<E, A> | null
}
