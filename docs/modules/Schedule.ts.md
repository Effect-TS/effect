`Schedule` ever decides not to continue, then the finalizer will be run.

    self: Schedule<Env, In, Out>,
    zero: Z,
    f: (z: Z, out: Out) => Effect<Env1, never, Z>
  ): Schedule<Env | Env1, In, Z>

# model

## Schedule (interface)

A `Schedule<Env, In, Out>` defines a recurring schedule, which consumes
values of type `In`, and which returns values of type `Out`.

Schedules are defined as a possibly infinite set of intervals spread out over
time. Each interval defines a window in which recurrence is possible.

When schedules are used to repeat or retry effects, the starting boundary of
each interval produced by a schedule is used as the moment when the effect
will be executed again.

Schedules compose in the following primary ways:

- Union: performs the union of the intervals of two schedules
- Intersection: performs the intersection of the intervals of two schedules
- Sequence: concatenates the intervals of one schedule onto another

In addition, schedule inputs and outputs can be transformed, filtered (to
terminate a schedule early in response to some input or output), and so
forth.

A variety of other operators exist for transforming and combining schedules,
and the companion object for `Schedule` contains all common types of
schedules, both for performing retrying, as well as performing repetition.

**Signature**

```ts
export interface Schedule<Env, In, Out> extends Schedule.Variance<Env, In, Out>, Pipeable {
  /**
   * Initial State
   */
  readonly initial: any
  /**
   * Schedule Step
   */
  readonly step: (
    now: number,
    input: In,
