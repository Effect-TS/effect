# exports

## From "./BigDecimal.js"

This module provides utility functions and type class instances for working with the `BigDecimal` type in TypeScript.
It includes functions for basic arithmetic operations, as well as type class instances for `Equivalence` and `Order`.

A `BigDecimal` allows storing any real number to arbitrary precision; which avoids common floating point errors
(such as 0.1 + 0.2 â‰  0.3) at the cost of complexity.

Internally, `BigDecimal` uses a `BigInt` object, paired with a 64-bit integer which determines the position of the
decimal point. Therefore, the precision _is not_ actually arbitrary, but limited to 2<sup>63</sup> decimal places.

It is not recommended to convert a floating point number to a decimal directly, as the floating point representation
may be unexpected.

**Signature**

```ts
export * as BigDecimal from "./BigDecimal.js"
```

Added in v2.0.0

## From "./BigInt.js"

This module provides utility functions and type class instances for working with the `bigint` type in TypeScript.
It includes functions for basic arithmetic operations, as well as type class instances for
`Equivalence` and `Order`.

**Signature**

```ts
export * as BigInt from "./BigInt.js"
```

Added in v2.0.0

## From "./Boolean.js"

This module provides utility functions and type class instances for working with the `boolean` type in TypeScript.
It includes functions for basic boolean operations, as well as type class instances for
`Equivalence` and `Order`.

**Signature**

```ts
export * as Boolean from "./Boolean.js"
```

Added in v2.0.0

## From "./Brand.js"

This module provides types and utility functions to create and work with branded types,
which are TypeScript types with an added type tag to prevent accidental usage of a value in the wrong context.

The `refined` and `nominal` functions are both used to create branded types in TypeScript.
The main difference between them is that `refined` allows for validation of the data, while `nominal` does not.

The `nominal` function is used to create a new branded type that has the same underlying type as the input, but with a different name.
This is useful when you want to distinguish between two values of the same type that have different meanings.
The `nominal` function does not perform any validation of the input data.

On the other hand, the `refined` function is used to create a new branded type that has the same underlying type as the input,
but with a different name, and it also allows for validation of the input data.
The `refined` function takes a predicate that is used to validate the input data.
If the input data fails the validation, a `BrandErrors` is returned, which provides information about the specific validation failure.

**Signature**

```ts
export * as Brand from "./Brand.js"
```

Added in v2.0.0

## From "./Cache.js"

Re-exports all named exports from the "./Cache.js" module as `Cache`.

**Signature**

```ts
export * as Cache from "./Cache.js"
```

Added in v2.0.0

## From "./Cause.js"

The `Effect<R, E, A>` type is polymorphic in values of type `E` and we can
work with any error type that we want. However, there is a lot of information
that is not inside an arbitrary `E` value. So as a result, an `Effect` needs
somewhere to store things like unexpected errors or defects, stack and
execution traces, causes of fiber interruptions, and so forth.

Effect-TS is very strict about preserving the full information related to a
failure. It captures all type of errors into the `Cause` data type. `Effect`
uses the `Cause<E>` data type to store the full story of failure. So its
error model is lossless. It doesn't throw information related to the failure
result. So we can figure out exactly what happened during the operation of
our effects.

It is important to note that `Cause` is an underlying data type representing
errors occuring within an `Effect` workflow. Thus, we don't usually deal with
`Cause`s directly. Even though it is not a data type that we deal with very
often, the `Cause` of a failing `Effect` workflow can be accessed at any
time, which gives us total access to all parallel and sequential errors in
occurring within our codebase.

**Signature**

```ts
export * as Cause from "./Cause.js"
```

## From "./Context.js"

This module provides a data structure called `Context` that can be used for dependency injection in effectful
programs. It is essentially a table mapping `Tag`s to their implementations (called `Service`s), and can be used to

of related services that can be passed around as a single unit. This module provides functions to create, modify, and
query the contents of a `Context`, as well as a number of utility types for working with tags and services.

## From "./Layer.js"

A `Layer<RIn, E, ROut>` describes how to build one or more services in your
application. Services can be injected into effects via
`Effect.provideService`. Effects can require services via `Effect.service`.

Layer can be thought of as recipes for producing bundles of services, given
their dependencies (other services).

Construction of services can be effectful and utilize resources that must be
acquired and safely released when the services are done being utilized.

By default layers are shared, meaning that if the same layer is used twice
the layer will only be allocated a single time.

Because of their excellent composition properties, layers are the idiomatic
way in Effect-TS to create services that depend on other services.

**Signature**

```ts
export * as Layer from "./Layer.js"
```

Added in v2.0.0

## From "./List.js"

A data type for immutable linked lists representing ordered collections of elements of type `A`.

This data type is optimal for last-in-first-out (LIFO), stack-like access patterns. If you need another access pattern, for example, random access or FIFO, consider using a collection more suited to this than `List`.

**Performance**

- Time: `List` has `O(1)` prepend and head/tail access. Most other operations are `O(n)` on the number of elements in the list. This includes the index-based lookup of elements, `length`, `append` and `reverse`.
- Space: `List` implements structural sharing of the tail list. This means that many operations are either zero- or constant-memory cost.

**Signature**

```ts
export * as List from "./List.js"
```

Added in v2.0.0

## From "./LogLevel.js"
