# constructors

## bounded

Makes a new bounded `Queue`. When the capacity of the queue is reached, any
additional calls to `offer` will be suspended until there is more room in
the queue.

**Note**: When possible use only power of 2 capacities; this will provide
better performance by utilising an optimised version of the underlying
`RingBuffer`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const bounded: <A>(requestedCapacity: number) => Effect<never, never, Queue<A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## dropping

Makes a new bounded `Queue` with the dropping strategy.

When the capacity of the queue is reached, new elements will be dropped and the
old elements will remain.

**Note**: When possible use only power of 2 capacities; this will provide
better performance by utilising an optimised version of the underlying
`RingBuffer`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const dropping: <A>(requestedCapacity: number) => Effect<never, never, Queue<A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## make

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const make: <A>(queue: BackingQueue<A>, strategy: Strategy<A>) => Effect<never, never, Queue<A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## sliding

Makes a new bounded `Queue` with the sliding strategy.

When the capacity of the queue is reached, new elements will be added and the
old elements will be dropped.

**Note**: When possible use only power of 2 capacities; this will provide
better performance by utilising an optimised version of the underlying
`RingBuffer`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const sliding: <A>(requestedCapacity: number) => Effect<never, never, Queue<A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## unbounded

Creates a new unbounded `Queue`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const unbounded: <A>() => Effect<never, never, Queue<A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

# getters

## capacity

Returns the number of elements the queue can hold.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const capacity: <A>(self: Dequeue<A> | Enqueue<A>) => number
```

Added in v2.0.0

## isEmpty

Returns `true` if the `Queue` contains zero elements, `false` otherwise.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const isEmpty: <A>(self: Dequeue<A> | Enqueue<A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## isFull

Returns `true` if the `Queue` contains at least one element, `false`
otherwise.

Added in v2.0.0

## size

Retrieves the size of the queue, which is equal to the number of elements
in the queue. This may be negative if fibers are suspended waiting for
elements to be added to the queue.

**Signature**

## offerAll

For Bounded Queue: uses the `BackPressure` Strategy, places the values in

it places the values otherwise it removes the old elements and enqueues the
new ones. Always returns true.

queue but if there is no room it will not enqueue them and return false.
