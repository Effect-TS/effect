# constructors

## make

Creates a new `Deferred`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const make: <E, A>() => Effect<never, never, Deferred<E, A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## makeAs

Creates a new `Deferred` from the specified `FiberId`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const makeAs: <E, A>(fiberId: FiberId.FiberId) => Effect<never, never, Deferred<E, A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

# getters

## await

Retrieves the value of the `Deferred`, suspending the fiber running the
workflow until the result is available.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const await: <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, E, A>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## isDone

Returns `true` if this `Deferred` has already been completed with a value or
an error, `false` otherwise.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const isDone: <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## poll

Returns a `Some<Effect<R, E, A>>` from the `Deferred` if this `Deferred` has
already been completed, `None` otherwise.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const poll: <E, A>(
  self: Deferred<E, A>
) => Effect<never, never, Option<Effect<never, E, A>>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

# models

## Deferred (interface)

A `Deferred` represents an asynchronous variable that can be set exactly
once, with the ability for an arbitrary number of fibers to suspend (by
calling `Deferred.await`) and automatically resume when the variable is set.

`Deferred` can be used for building primitive actions whose completions
require the coordinated action of multiple fibers, and for building
higher-level concurrent or asynchronous structures.

**Signature**

```ts
export interface Deferred<E, A> extends Deferred.Variance<E, A>, Pipeable {
  /** @internal */
  readonly state: MutableRef<internal.State<E, A>>
  /** @internal */
  readonly blockingOn: FiberId
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

# symbols

## DeferredTypeId

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const DeferredTypeId: typeof DeferredTypeId
```

Added in v2.0.0

## DeferredTypeId (type alias)

**Signature**

```ts
export type DeferredTypeId = typeof DeferredTypeId
```

Added in v2.0.0

# unsafe

## unsafeDone

Unsafely exits the `Deferred` with the specified `Exit` value, which will be
propagated to all fibers waiting on the value of the `Deferred`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const unsafeDone: <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, effect: Effect<never, E, A>) => void
```

Added in v2.0.0

## unsafeMake

Unsafely creates a new `Deferred` from the specified `FiberId`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const unsafeMake: <E, A>(fiberId: FiberId.FiberId) => Deferred<E, A>
```

Added in v2.0.0

# utils

## Deferred (namespace)

Added in v2.0.0

### Variance (interface)

**Signature**

```ts
export interface Variance<E, A> {
  readonly [DeferredTypeId]: {
    readonly _E: (_: never) => E
    readonly _A: (_: never) => A
  }
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## complete

Completes the deferred with the result of the specified effect. If the
deferred has already been completed, the method will produce false.

Note that `Deferred.completeWith` will be much faster, so consider using
that if you do not need to memoize the result of the specified effect.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const complete: {
  <E, A>(effect: Effect<never, E, A>): (self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, effect: Effect<never, E, A>): Effect<never, never, boolean>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## completeWith

Completes the deferred with the result of the specified effect. If the
deferred has already been completed, the method will produce false.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const completeWith: {
  <E, A>(effect: Effect<never, E, A>): (self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, effect: Effect<never, E, A>): Effect<never, never, boolean>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## die

Kills the `Deferred` with the specified defect, which will be propagated to
all fibers waiting on the value of the `Deferred`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const die: {
  (defect: unknown): <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, defect: unknown): Effect<never, never, boolean>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## dieSync

Kills the `Deferred` with the specified defect, which will be propagated to
all fibers waiting on the value of the `Deferred`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const dieSync: {
  (evaluate: LazyArg<unknown>): <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, evaluate: LazyArg<unknown>): Effect<never, never, boolean>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## done

Exits the `Deferred` with the specified `Exit` value, which will be
propagated to all fibers waiting on the value of the `Deferred`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const done: {
  <E, A>(exit: Exit<E, A>): (self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, exit: Exit<E, A>): Effect<never, never, boolean>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## fail

all fibers waiting on the value of the `Deferred`.

```ts
export declare const fail: {
  <E>(error: E): <A>(self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, error: E): Effect<never, never, boolean>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## failCause

all fibers waiting on the value of the `Deferred`.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const failCause: {
  <E>(cause: Cause<E>): <A>(self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, cause: Cause<E>): Effect<never, never, boolean>
}

## failCauseSync

all fibers waiting on the value of the `Deferred`.

**Signature**

export declare const failCauseSync: {
  <E>(evaluate: LazyArg<Cause<E>>): <A>(self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, evaluate: LazyArg<Cause<E>>): Effect<never, never, boolean>

  <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>, evaluate: LazyArg<E>): Effect<never, never, boolean>
}
```

## interrupt

waiting on the value of the `Deferred` with the `FiberId` of the fiber
calling this method.

```ts
export declare const interruptWith: {
  (fiberId: FiberId.FiberId): <E, A>(self: Deferred<E, A>) => Effect<never, never, boolean>
