# combinators

## get

Retrieves an item from the pool belonging to the given key in a scoped
effect. Note that if acquisition fails, then the returned effect will fail
for that same reason. Retrying a failed acquisition attempt will repeat the
acquisition attempt.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const get: {
  <K>(key: K): <E, A>(self: KeyedPool<K, E, A>) => Effect<Scope.Scope, E, A>
  <K, E, A>(self: KeyedPool<K, E, A>, key: K): Effect<Scope.Scope, E, A>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

## invalidate

Invalidates the specified item. This will cause the pool to eventually
reallocate the item, although this reallocation may occur lazily rather
than eagerly.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const invalidate: {
  <A>(item: A): <K, E>(self: KeyedPool<K, E, A>) => Effect<never, never, void>
  <K, E, A>(self: KeyedPool<K, E, A>, item: A): Effect<never, never, void>
}
```

Added in v2.0.0

# constructors

## make

Makes a new pool of the specified fixed size. The pool is returned in a
`Scope`, which governs the lifetime of the pool. When the pool is shutdown
because the `Scope` is closed, the individual items allocated by the pool
will be released in some unspecified order.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const make: <K, R, E, A>(options: {
  readonly acquire: (key: K) => Effect<R, E, A>
  readonly size: number
}) => Effect<Scope.Scope | R, never, KeyedPool<K, E, A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## makeWith

Makes a new pool of the specified fixed size. The pool is returned in a
`Scope`, which governs the lifetime of the pool. When the pool is shutdown
because the `Scope` is closed, the individual items allocated by the pool
will be released in some unspecified order.

The size of the underlying pools can be configured per key.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const makeWith: <K, R, E, A>(options: {
  readonly acquire: (key: K) => Effect<R, E, A>
  readonly size: (key: K) => number
}) => Effect<Scope.Scope | R, never, KeyedPool<K, E, A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## makeWithTTL

Makes a new pool with the specified minimum and maximum sizes and time to
live before a pool whose excess items are not being used will be shrunk
down to the minimum size. The pool is returned in a `Scope`, which governs
the lifetime of the pool. When the pool is shutdown because the `Scope` is
used, the individual items allocated by the pool will be released in some
unspecified order.

The size of the underlying pools can be configured per key.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const makeWithTTL: <K, R, E, A>(options: {
  readonly acquire: (key: K) => Effect<R, E, A>
  readonly min: (key: K) => number
  readonly max: (key: K) => number
  readonly timeToLive: Duration.DurationInput
}) => Effect<Scope.Scope | R, never, KeyedPool<K, E, A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

## makeWithTTLBy

Makes a new pool with the specified minimum and maximum sizes and time to
live before a pool whose excess items are not being used will be shrunk
down to the minimum size. The pool is returned in a `Scope`, which governs
the lifetime of the pool. When the pool is shutdown because the `Scope` is
used, the individual items allocated by the pool will be released in some
unspecified order.

The size of the underlying pools can be configured per key.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const makeWithTTLBy: <K, R, E, A>(options: {
  readonly acquire: (key: K) => Effect<R, E, A>
  readonly min: (key: K) => number
  readonly max: (key: K) => number
  readonly timeToLive: (key: K) => Duration.DurationInput
}) => Effect<Scope.Scope | R, never, KeyedPool<K, E, A>>
```

Added in v2.0.0

# models

## KeyedPool (interface)

A `KeyedPool<K, E, A>` is a pool of `Pool`s of items of type `A`. Each pool
in the `KeyedPool` is associated with a key of type `K`.

**Signature**

```ts
export interface KeyedPool<K, E, A> extends KeyedPool.Variance<K, E, A>, Pipeable {
  /**
   * Retrieves an item from the pool belonging to the given key in a scoped
   * effect. Note that if acquisition fails, then the returned effect will fail
   * for that same reason. Retrying a failed acquisition attempt will repeat the
   * acquisition attempt.
   */
  get(key: K): Effect<Scope.Scope, E, A>

  /**
   * Invalidates the specified item. This will cause the pool to eventually
   * reallocate the item, although this reallocation may occur lazily rather
   * than eagerly.
   */
  invalidate(item: A): Effect<never, never, void>
}
